## 🎯 Mission

### Our Purpose Today

**Equip players, educators, and institutions with a persistent UK parliamentary simulation that blends human play and AI assistance to build civic literacy, foster safe political discourse, and uphold governance-by-design standards.**

### Game Identity

Political Sphere is a persistent, multiplayer political simulation game based on the institutional and procedural foundations of the United Kingdom's political system. It is a game—not a civic platform, not a training tool, not a real political process—designed with realism, accuracy, and procedural integrity to create an immersive, credible simulation of political life.

- **Genre**: Political simulation / strategy / role-play / governance sim
- **Mode**: Online, multi-player, persistent world
- **Model**: Live service with evolving mechanics and systems
- **Focus**: Institutional realism, strategic depth, social interaction, ethical decision-making

### Game Goals

Players experience the dynamics of UK political life by:

- Forming parties & internal factions
- Competing for power & influence
- Participating in simulated parliamentary processes
- Drafting, debating, and voting on bills and motions
- Managing public opinion and media dynamics
- Navigating internal party discipline and strategy
- Building alliances, coalitions, and rivalries
- Contesting elections within the simulation
- Managing reputation, political capital, and public trust

### Player Roles (Initial MVP)

- **Member of Parliament (MP)**: Primary player role
- **Party leadership roles**: Party leader, deputy, whips (player-earned)
- **Media/Press roles**: Optional future expansion
- **Civil society & interest groups**: Optional future expansion

AI-controlled NPCs supplement players where necessary.

### World Model

Persistent world with simulated:

- Government & opposition structures
- Parliamentary calendar & procedures
- Constituencies & elections
- Public sentiment models
- Media influence and narrative dynamics
- Political parties and internal mechanisms
- Legislative and policy processes

### Gameplay Philosophy

- **Skill-based strategy**: Influence, negotiation, timing, planning
- **Consequences & accountability**: Actions affect reputation, alliances, and outcomes
- **Procedural integrity**: Rules of play grounded in real-world political mechanics
- **Player agency**: Broad freedom to act within structured systems
- **Competitive and cooperative dynamics**: Alliances, rivalries, negotiation

### AI Function in Game

AI agents serve as:

- NPC MPs and political actors
- Public sentiment & voter behaviour systems
- Journalistic and narrative engines (future)
- Policy analysis & simulation tools (internal)
- Moderation support (human-in-the-loop)
- Automated orchestration for development & governance

AI exists inside the game and behind the scenes.

### Safety & Ethics Position

Political Sphere is a game, but one grounded in real political systems and public concepts. To protect users and maintain integrity:

- Real-world persuasion is prohibited
- Moderation & safety systems are enforced
- Fair-play and authenticity rules apply
- AI behaviour is monitored and constrained
- No real-world political instruction or mobilisation

This is a simulated political environment, not a real one. It is educational by function, not by mandate.

### Technical Philosophy

- Modern, modular architecture
- AI-first, compliance-first design
- Monorepo (Nx) with structured governance
- High observability, test coverage, security controls
- Designed to scale features and player population gradually

### Mission Pillars

1. **Authentic Parliamentary Mechanics**  
   Replicate Commons, Lords, Cabinet, media, and civil service dynamics—including motions, debates, amendments, divisions, whips, elections, and constitutional nuance—so users experience how Westminster really works.

2. **AI-Assisted Gameplay & Operations**  
   Harness AI NPCs, moderation, and developer automation to enrich scenarios, maintain safety, and accelerate delivery while keeping humans in control of high-impact decisions.

3. **Safety, Accessibility, and Compliance**  
   Embed GDPR, UK Online Safety Act, and WCAG 2.2 AA requirements from inception; ensure every interaction respects privacy, wellbeing, and equitable access.

4. **Governance & Auditability**  
   Operate with ISO-aligned governance, traceability, and risk management so educators and institutions can trust the platform for serious civic learning.

5. **Commercial-Grade Developer Experience**  
   Invest in fast builds, automated testing, CI/CD, and observability to keep iteration rapid without sacrificing reliability.
