# ADR-0003: TypeScript with Strict Mode

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Deciders:** Technical Lead, Development Team  
**Technical Story:** Type Safety and Code Quality

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a primary programming language and type system for the Political Sphere codebase that ensures type safety, maintainability, and developer productivity.

## Decision Drivers

- Type safety to prevent runtime errors
- Developer productivity and tooling support
- Code maintainability and refactoring capabilities
- Industry best practices for modern web applications
- Team expertise and learning curve

## Considered Options

- **Option 1**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Option 2**: JavaScript with JSDoc type annotations
- **Option 3**: TypeScript with loose configuration
- **Option 4**: Flow (Facebook's type system)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "TypeScript with strict mode enabled"

**Justification:** TypeScript strict mode provides the strongest type safety guarantees, catching errors at compile time that would otherwise manifest at runtime. This is critical for a democratic governance platform where correctness is paramount.

### Positive Consequences

- Compile-time error detection
- Superior IDE support and autocomplete
- Refactoring confidence with type checking
- Self-documenting code through types
- Prevents common JavaScript pitfalls (undefined, null, type coercion)

### Negative Consequences

- Initial development may be slower
- Requires type definitions for third-party libraries
- Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript
- Additional build step required

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### TypeScript with strict mode

**Pros:**

- Maximum type safety (`strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, etc.)
- Catches edge cases at compile time
- Forces explicit handling of nullable values
- Industry standard for large-scale applications

**Cons:**

- More verbose than loose TypeScript
- Requires disciplined type annotations
- May require `unknown` over `any` (safer but more work)

### JavaScript with JSDoc

**Pros:**

- No build step required
- Gradual typing adoption
- Familiar syntax for JavaScript developers

**Cons:**

- Weaker type checking
- Less tooling support
- Type annotations in comments (not first-class)

### TypeScript with loose configuration

**Pros:**

- Easier migration from JavaScript
- Less strict requirements

**Cons:**

- Misses many potential bugs
- `any` types escape type checking
- False sense of security

## Links

- [TypeScript Strict Mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict)
- `/docs/05-engineering-and-devops/languages/typescript.md`
- `/tsconfig.json`

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] **Quality (QUAL-01 to QUAL-09)**: Type safety improves code quality
- [x] **Security (SEC-01 to SEC-10)**: Prevents type-related vulnerabilities
- [x] **Operations (OPS-01 to OPS-05)**: Type checking in CI prevents runtime errors

## Notes

**Strict mode flags enabled:**

- `strict: true` (enables all strict checks)
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` (array access safety)
- `noImplicitReturns: true` (explicit returns required)
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true` (switch statement safety)

**Avoid `any` type** - Use `unknown` or proper types instead.
