## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide end-to-end tracing from player request to AI decision to audit log.
- Deliver actionable metrics and alerts aligned with SLOs and error budgets.
- Ensure compliance-ready logging with privacy safeguards.

---

## 🧱 Telemetry Stack

| Pillar | Tooling | Notes |
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| **Tracing** | OpenTelemetry SDK (Node.js, React via W3C Trace Context), Tempo/Jaeger (TBD) | Every request carries `traceId`; spans include tenant, feature flag state |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus-compatible exporters, Grafana dashboards | Standard metrics library, RED/USE dashboards per service |
| **Logging** | Pino structured logs → Loki/Elastic | JSON logs with redaction middleware; correlation IDs mandatory |
| **APM** | OpenTelemetry collectors feeding into vendor-neutral backend | Evaluate Lightstep/New Relic after MVP if needed |

---

## 🔍 Instrumentation Standards

- **Service Metadata:** Include `service.name`, `service.version`, `deployment.environment` on every span/metric/log.
- **Correlation:** Propagate `traceId` through GraphQL resolvers, REST handlers, worker jobs, and NATS events; realtime gateway annotates messages with `traceId`.
- **PII Hygiene:** Redaction middleware strips emails, IPs, UGC; safe hashes stored when correlation needed; comply with GDPR logging guidance.
- **AI Transparency:** AI orchestration emits spans for prompt generation, provider calls, safety filters, human handoff; logs stored in Safety Transparency Log.
- **Frontend Insight:** React app integrates Web Vitals, error boundaries, and trace context to tie UX issues back to backend spans.

## 📊 Dashboards

| Dashboard | KPIs | Consumers |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| **Platform SLO** | API latency/error rate, realtime lag, queue depth | Platform, Product |
| **Gameplay Health** | Debate join success, vote latency, AI assist usage, NPC errors | Product, Game Design |
| **Safety & Moderation** | Report volume, SLA adherence, moderator backlog, false positives/negatives | Safety, Compliance |
| **AI Quality** | Prompt throughput, provider latency, refusal rate, evaluation scores | AI Ops, Ethics |
| **Infrastructure** | CPU/memory/disk, cost metrics, node health | DevOps |

---

## 🔔 Alerting

- Alerts defined per SLO with playbooks referenced in [On-Call Handbook](../09-observability-and-ops/on-call-and-incident-handbook.md).
- Multi-channel notifications (PagerDuty/Slack/Email) with severity tiers.
- AI-specific alerts (model failure, safety bypass, evaluation regression) escalate to AI Ops + Ethics Committee.

---

## 🧪 Observability QA

- Include instrumentation tests in CI to ensure critical spans/metrics/logs emitted.
- Run synthetic monitors for key journeys (login, debate, vote, moderation) to collect baseline telemetry.
- Observability reviews during readiness checks, ADRs, and postmortems to capture gaps.

Observability is the feedback loop that keeps Political Sphere accountable—instrument early, review often, and evolve dashboards with stakeholder needs.
