## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How often should foundation documents be updated?

**A:** Foundation documents are reviewed quarterly, but updated only when significant changes are needed. Vision and values change infrequently (annual review), while market briefs and personas may update more frequently based on new insights.

### Q: Who can propose changes to foundation documents?

**A:** Any team member can propose foundation changes, but they must be sponsored by a department head. Major changes require executive approval and follow the [change management process](../document-control/review-and-approval-workflow.md).

### Q: How do foundation documents relate to project documentation?

**A:** Foundation documents provide the "why" and strategic context, while project documentation in other sections provides the "how" and tactical implementation. All project docs should reference and align with foundation principles.

### Q: What if there's conflict between foundation principles and business needs?

**A:** Foundation principles provide guardrails, not absolute restrictions. Conflicts should be escalated to leadership for resolution, potentially resulting in foundation updates if business needs require strategic shifts.

### Q: How are foundation documents communicated to external stakeholders?

**A:** Vision, mission, and values are publicly shared. Business model and market positioning are shared with partners and investors. Internal foundation details remain confidential to maintain competitive advantage.
