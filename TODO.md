## Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze current Jest setup and identify issues
- [x] Create comprehensive improvement plan
- [x] Get user approval for plan
- [x] Consolidate Jest configurations: Merge overlapping settings from jest.preset.cjs and jest.config.cjs into a single app-specific config extending the root preset
- [x] Optimize performance: Add parallel test execution (maxWorkers), enable caching, and adjust timeouts
- [x] Enhance coverage: Lower coverage thresholds to 70% for MVP stage to focus on core functionality
- [x] Improve clarity and maintainability: Add comments to jest.config.cjs, refactor jest.setup.js to separate test utilities into a dedicated file
- [x] Address security: Ensure all secrets use environment variables in tests
- [x] Fix test runner inconsistency: Convert Node.js test files to Jest syntax for consistency
- [x] Add unit test templates and suggest E2E integration with Playwright
- [x] Update docs/TODO.md with completed tasks and new testing requirements
- [x] Run tests to verify changes
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with configuration improvements
- [x] Update jest.config.cjs with improved configuration, comments, and lowered coverage thresholds
- [x] Add performance optimizations (maxWorkers, cache, testTimeout)
- [x] Improve security by using environment variables for secrets
- [x] Add Content-Type headers to test requests to fix API issues
- [x] Run tests and identify database/storage issues causing 500 errors
- [x] Fix ESM/CommonJS module resolution in test environment causing database initialization hangs
- [x] Resolve disk I/O error on journal_mode pragma in better-sqlite3
- [x] Fix temp DB file issues in test environment

- [x] Implement proper test database isolation (separate DB per test or in-memory)
- [x] Fix hanging tests for "should return user by id" and "should return 400 for duplicate username"
- [x] Test individual test cases: Verified "should return 400 for invalid input" and "should return 404 for non-existent user" pass; "should create a new user" now passes after database connectivity fixes
- [x] Identify root cause: Database initialization hanging due to ESM/CommonJS module resolution issues in test environment
- [x] Fix test runner inconsistency by converting to Jest globals
- [x] Verify individual tests pass: "should return user by id" and "should return 400 for duplicate username" now pass

## Issues Found During Testing

- [x] Test runner inconsistency: Tests use Node.js test syntax but Jest config expects Jest syntax - FIXED: Changed to @jest/globals
- [x] Content-Type issue: Tests failing with 415 "Unsupported Media Type" - FIXED: Added Content-Type headers to all POST requests
- [x] Import timing issue: "You are trying to `import` a file after the Jest environment has been torn down" - RESOLVED: Test now passes successfully
- [ ] Database/storage issues: Tests failing with 500 errors, likely due to missing database setup or connection problems
- [ ] ESM/CommonJS compatibility: Need to ensure proper module resolution for test files

- [x] Added reflection principle: acknowledge mistakes, correct them, reflect on them, prevent recurrence through systematic analysis and proactive prevention measures
- [x] Improved AI parsing efficiency with structured formatting and clear interaction guidelines
- [x] Update root README to reflect current monorepo structure and commands (2025-11-01)

## Database Issues Identified
