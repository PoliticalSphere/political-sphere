# Contributing quickstart

Thanks for contributing to Political Sphere! This quickstart helps you open a low-friction PR.

1) Branching
	- Create a topic branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/your-change`

2) Commit messages
	- Use Conventional Commits: `type(scope): short description` (e.g., `fix(api): handle 500 on login`).
	- We use these messages for automated changelogs and release tooling.

3) Run tests & lint locally
	- Install and prepare: `npm ci`
	- Run linters: `npm run lint`
	- Run tests: `npm test`

4) PR labels and size
	- Path-based labels are applied automatically by the labeler action (see `.github/labeler.yml`).
	- A size label (XS/S/M/L/XL) is applied to PRs so reviewers can triage quickly.

5) CI & checks
	- CI runs tests, lint, docs checks and security gates. Fix any failing checks before requesting review.

6) Good first contributions
	- Use the "Good first issue" issue form in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` to help onboard contributors; it will add `good first issue` label.

7) Questions & support
	- If you need help, open an issue labeled `triage` or contact the maintainers listed in `CODEOWNERS`.
