# AI Strategy and Differentiation

## Overview

Political Sphere uses AI ethically and constrainedly to enhance gameplay without compromising safety, fairness, or the simulation's integrity. AI is a tool for immersion and efficiency, not persuasion or ideology.

## AI Role in Political Sphere

AI exists to:

- Fill NPC roles (e.g., MPs in small worlds)
- Enforce rules and moderate content
- Assist human moderators
- Summarize debates for players
- Provide procedural guidance

AI does **not**:

- Persuade players politically
- Manipulate emotions
- Harvest or analyze personal data
- Opininate about real-world ideology
- Turn into propaganda or activism tools

## Differentiation: Ethical, Bounded AI

### Human-Guided, Ethics-Constrained

- All AI prompts are rule-based and constrained to fictional, internal-world behavior.
- No real-world political content in prompts.
- Human oversight on all AI moderation decisions.
- AI actions are logged and explainable.

### Local Models Only

- Use self-hosted, local AI models (e.g., Ollama, local LLMs).
- No cloud dependencies or external data sharing.
- Aligns with zero-budget, privacy-first ethos.

### Transparency and Auditability

- AI decisions are logged with reasoning.
- Players can appeal AI-moderated actions.
- No "black box" AI; all behavior is traceable.

## Competitive Advantages from AI Strategy

1. **Trustworthy NPCs:** AI fills seats without human burnout, maintaining world activity.
2. **Scalable Moderation:** Assists in enforcing rules at scale, but humans retain control.
3. **Enhanced Immersion:** NPCs behave procedurally, adding depth without ideology.
4. **Safety Moat:** Ethical constraints prevent misuse, building player confidence.
5. **Cost-Effective:** Local models keep costs zero, no API fees.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Misalignment Risk:** AI behavior could drift from ethics.
  - Mitigation: Strict prompt engineering, regular audits, human overrides.

- **Perception of Bias:** Players might see AI as unfair.
  - Mitigation: Full transparency, appeals process, explainability logs.

- **Over-Reliance:** Humans might trust AI too much.
  - Mitigation: AI as assistant, not authority; human final say.

## Implementation Principles

- **Minimalism:** AI only where it adds value without risk.
- **Containment:** AI stays within fictional political universe.
- **Iterative:** Start simple (rule-based NPCs), expand with testing.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to AI ethics guidelines (e.g., EU AI Act).

## Alignment with Vision

This AI strategy supports the core mission: a fair, persistent simulation where conduct and strategy matter. AI enhances without dominating, preserving human agency and ethical boundaries.
