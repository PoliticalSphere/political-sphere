## 📊 Balancing Considerations

- **Skill vs Luck:** Emphasis on strategy over randomness.
- **Time Investment:** Reward consistent participation, not grinding.
- **Fair Competition:** Anti-exploit measures prevent unfair advantages.
- **Scalability:** Mechanics work for small (10 players) to large worlds.

---

## 🧪 Playtesting and Iteration

- **Alpha Testing:** Core loop validation with small groups.
- **Beta Testing:** Full mechanics with feedback loops.
- **Live Balancing:** Monitor metrics, adjust based on data.
- **Player Feedback:** Surveys and analytics for continuous improvement.
