# AI Governance (Constitutional Safeguards)

**Version:** 2.0.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-11-05

## Transparency Requirements

Document ALL AI systems with: Model/agent purpose and scope. Known limitations and failure modes. Training data sources and methodology. Identified biases and risks. Model cards (standardized format).

## Autonomy Boundaries

Define human oversight checkpoints. **Require human approval for:** Publishing political content. Accessing user data. Changing policies. High-stakes decisions. Document escalation paths for each.

## Political Neutrality (Critical)

Protect democratic integrity: ❌ NO AI system may manipulate political outcomes. ✅ Implement neutrality tests. ✅ Build manipulation resistance. ✅ Provide contestability mechanisms. ✅ Enable user appeals. ✅ Conduct regular bias audits.

## Fairness & Robustness

Test AI systems rigorously: Conduct bias assessments. Test across demographic groups. Red-team for adversarial attacks. Benchmark against fairness metrics. Document mitigation strategies.

## Data Governance for AI

Manage AI data responsibly: Track dataset provenance (full lineage). Validate consent and licensing. Version datasets with metadata. Apply retention policies. Respect data subject rights.

## Monitoring & Drift Detection

Continuously monitor AI systems: Track model performance metrics. Detect and alert on drift. Use safe rollout strategies (shadow/canary). Maintain rollback plans. Version prompts and configurations.

## Interrogability & Explainability

Make AI decisions auditable: Provide structured reasoning/explanations. Enable authorized audit access. Retain decision traces (privacy-safe). Support contestability. Log AI actions with full context.
