- **Critical Priorities — Immediate**
  - [ ] Fix 6 failing tests in `apps/api/tests/` (parties.test.mjs, users.test.mjs) — _Testing Infrastructure Core Principle_
  - [x] Migrate JavaScript files to TypeScript strict mode (`apps/game-server/src/`) — _Core Rule #1: Type-safe_ _(Completed: 2025-11-07)_
    - Created: complianceClient.ts, moderationClient.ts, ageVerificationClient.ts, index.ts with full type safety
    - All 285 tests passing, Biome linter clean
    - Next: Remove old .js files after verification
  - [ ] Remove 7 `eslint-disable` comments by fixing underlying issues — _Code Quality Standards_
  - [ ] Fix GitHub workflow secret context access errors (50+ errors) — _Operations Standards_
- **High Priorities — This Sprint**
  - [ ] Add React component test coverage (Dashboard.jsx, GameBoard.jsx) — _80%+ coverage requirement_
  - [ ] Enable frontend in coverage config with proper Babel/SWC setup
  - [ ] Run security audit: `npm run fast-secure` — _Zero-Trust Compliance_
  - [ ] Verify no cached auth checks — _High-Risk Pattern #2_
  - [ ] Ensure no debounce on voting flows — _High-Risk Pattern #1_
- **Medium Priorities — This Month**
  - [ ] Run accessibility audit: `npm run audit:full` — _WCAG 2.2 AA Mandatory_
  - [ ] Verify voting mechanism constitutional compliance
  - [ ] Review seed data for political neutrality — _High-Risk Pattern #6_
  - [ ] Document all changes in `CHANGELOG.md` — _Change Management requirement_

## Reference

### Per-app Test Runner & Shims (Added 2025-11-05)

We added convenience tooling and lightweight shims to make per-application test runs fast and reliable without changing the repository-wide runner.

- Use Vitest as the unified test runner (Jest not required).
- Frontend tests (`jsdom`):

```bash
VITEST_APP=frontend VITEST_ENV=jsdom npx vitest --environment jsdom --run apps/frontend
```

- API tests (node environment):

```bash
npx vitest --run "apps/api/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,mjs,ts,tsx,jsx,tsx}"
# or use the npm helper
npm run test:api
```

- Shared shims (`scripts/test-setup.ts`):
  - Expose `React` on `globalThis` for legacy JSX
  - Import `@testing-library/jest-dom` for robust DOM matchers
  - Provide `matchMedia` polyfill for jsdom
  - Load CJS-friendly shim for `@political-sphere/shared`

If `jest-dom` is not desired, remove the import in `scripts/test-setup.ts` and drop the dependency.

## Notes

- All documents should include document control metadata at the bottom.
- Content must remain accessible, inclusive, and follow plain-language principles.
- Consider AI/ML and political simulation-specific examples where relevant.
- Potential risks: Legal review may be required for sensitive policies; flag content touching on unapproved areas.
