## 🎯 Overview

Build and validate the core multiplayer parliamentary gameplay loop in a safe, fair, and persistent environment.

**Goal:** End this phase with a playable, testable prototype where players can debate, vote, and experience procedural political play — even if the world is tiny and unpolished.

---

## 🎯 Objective 1: Core Game Mechanics Online

Deliver a functional parliamentary gameplay core.

| Key Results | Success Criteria |
|-------------|------------------|
| KR1 | Players can log in, select a world, and create a character |
| KR2 | Basic parliament cycle works: sitting → debate → vote → result |
| KR3 | Debate queue + speech submission working in real time |
| KR4 | Voting + tally + publish results system live |
| KR5 | Minimal moderation tools available (mute, flag, remove content) |

**Definition of Done:** Two players can simulate a debate and vote in a persistent world, without dev intervention.

---

## 🎯 Objective 2: Persistence, Stability & Fairness

Lay the technical foundation for a trustworthy simulation.

| Key Results | Success Criteria |
|-------------|------------------|
| KR1 | PostgreSQL world state + core entities implemented |
| KR2 | Real-time events via WebSockets (debates + votes) |
| KR3 | Idempotent voting & audit logs for key actions |
| KR4 | Basic RLS or world-scoped ACLs in place |
| KR5 | Automated tests covering core political flows |

**Definition of Done:** Game state never corrupts, double-voting prevented, and actions traceable.

---

## 🎯 Objective 3: Player Safety & Containment

Establish a minimum viable trust & safety layer.

| Key Results | Success Criteria |
|-------------|------------------|
| KR1 | Reporting system live (players can flag speech/actions) |
| KR2 | Manual moderation dashboard working |
| KR3 | Guardrails preventing real-world political content |
| KR4 | Code of Conduct drafted and visible to testers |

**Definition of Done:** Testers can play safely without drama or real politics creeping in.

---

## 🎯 Objective 4: Basic AI Support (Local)

Introduce ethical, bounded NPC functionality using local models.

| Key Results | Success Criteria |
|-------------|------------------|
| KR1 | Local LLM NPC MPs with rule-based scaffolding |
| KR2 | NPCs can participate in basic debate or vote behavior |
| KR3 | No real-world political content allowed in AI prompts |
| KR4 | NPC actions logged + explainability stub |

**Definition of Done:** NPCs fill empty seats & behave within constraints — without ideology.

---

## 🎯 Objective 5: Closed Testing & Feedback Loop

Start tiny-community testing and iteration.

| Key Results | Success Criteria |
|-------------|------------------|
| KR1 | 5–15 private testers onboarded |
| KR2 | Weekly feedback review, visible to testers |
| KR3 | First gameplay tutorial flow stubbed |
| KR4 | Publish change notes each sprint |

**Definition of Done:** A small trusted group can play, give feedback, and see the game improve.

## 🔗 Alignment with Vision

| Vision Principle | OKR Alignment |
|------------------|---------------|
| Fairness | No pay advantages, audit logs, idempotent actions |
| Procedural integrity | Debate & vote mechanics implemented first |
| Safety & ethics | Guardrails, moderation, reporting |
| Persistence | Stable world state & progression systems |
| Thoughtful strategy | Debate & reputation systems before "flashy" |
| Zero-budget | Local stack, incremental build, tiny tester group |
| No real-world politics | Containment systems built early |

We're building a serious, credible simulation world, not a Discord role-play server or political playground.

---

## 📊 Success Look-Like (6-month snapshot)

If things are going well, you should be able to say:

You can log in, become an MP, take part in a scheduled debate, deliver a speech, vote on a motion, see results, and your history persists — safely, fairly, and without chaos.

Not flashy — functional, principled, real.
