| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----- |
| Rare           | Unlikely to occur (<5% probability) | 1     |
| Unlikely       | Possible but not probable (5-25%)   | 2     |
| Possible       | Could occur (25-50%)                | 3     |
| Likely         | Probable occurrence (50-75%)        | 4     |
| Almost Certain | Highly likely (>75%)                | 5     |

| Impact       | Description                                   | Score |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Negligible   | No significant impact                         | 1     |
| Minor        | Limited impact on operations                  | 2     |
| Moderate     | Noticeable impact, manageable                 | 3     |
| Major        | Significant operational disruption            | 4     |
| Catastrophic | System failure, legal/regulatory consequences | 5     |

**Risk Level Calculation:**

```
Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact
```

**Risk Level Matrix:**

| Risk Score | Risk Level | Action Required     |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| 1-4        | Low        | Monitor             |
| 5-9        | Medium     | Mitigate            |
| 10-15      | High       | Address Immediately |
| 16-25      | Critical   | Stop and Fix        |
