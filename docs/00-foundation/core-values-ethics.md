## 🎯 Purpose


## Operational strengthening

### Ethics by Design

All features must include an ethical impact summary before implementation (a mini DPIA). This summary is a required developer artefact and should identify potential harms, mitigation steps, and which item in the constitutional override logic applies.

### Product metrics > Vanity metrics

We optimise for informed participation and learning outcomes, not time-on-site, virality, or emotionally manipulative signals. Product success metrics should prioritise civic competence, fairness, and retention of informed behaviours.

## How this applies in practice — 6 sample edge cases

1. Fake campaign promising direct cash payouts.
  - Allowed as satire mechanics if clearly fictional and disconnected from real money.
  - Disallowed: any mechanism enabling real-player fundraising, payment links, or real-world mobilisation.
2. Player-run referendum urging real-world action.
  - Allowed: in-game referendum with in-game consequences only.
  - Disallowed: any content that directs players to external real-world events or mobilises off-platform action.
3. AI-generated 'opinion leader' NPC that mimics a real person.
  - Allowed only if explicitly fictional, provenance included, and cannot be used to contact or influence real accounts.
4. Targeted messaging to swing in-game votes.
  - Allowed as game mechanic when targeted messages are purely fictional and transparent.
  - Disallowed: targeted content that profiles players for likely real-world political persuasion; profiling is prohibited.
5. Satirical ads causing emotional escalation.
  - Allowed as labelled satire with safe-guards and opt-outs.
  - Disallowed: emotionally manipulative content designed to increase engagement via outrage.
6. Cross-play with external social platforms.
  - Allowed: sharing anonymised, non-political achievement badges.
  - Disallowed: any pipeline that enriches contact lists, political persuasion, or recruitment.

## 📋 Ethical Decision Framework
Political Sphere teaches the skills of democratic life by simulating politics responsibly, transparently, and free from real-world influence.

We operate like a democracy, not a casino; like a civic institution, not a tech product.

Our Core Values & Ethics framework is a commitment and social contract with players, partners, and society. It sets active obligations for design, moderation, and product choices so that the platform teaches civic practice without enabling real-world persuasion or harm.

### Purpose of Values — our core promise

We pledge to:

- Centre player safety, dignity and informed civic learning in every design choice.
- Build and maintain a simulation that is fair, auditable, and resilient to abuse.
- Avoid any feature, AI, or mechanic that can be used to influence real-world political beliefs or behaviour.
- Prioritise learning outcomes, accountability, and process over vanity engagement metrics.

The values apply to gameplay, community, development, and business practices.

### Proposed Ethical Order of Priority (constitutional override logic)

To make trade-offs clear, we adopt this hierarchy of first principles. When principles conflict, higher items override lower ones:

1. User safety & dignity
2. Simulation integrity & fairness
3. No real-world political influence (zero pipeline to real politics)
4. Learning outcomes over engagement
5. Transparency & accountability
6. Innovation that honours the above

This hierarchy is our constitutional override logic — it guides design reviews, risk assessments, and escalation.

## 🌟 Core Values

### Fairness

- All players operate on equal terms
- No paid advantages or influence
- Rules are applied consistently
- Server-authoritative simulation

**Meaning:**
Outcome is earned through in-world conduct, strategy, and relationships — not money, manipulation, or privilege.

### Integrity of Simulation

- The game world behaves consistently and predictably
- Parliamentary processes work as rules-based systems
- No arbitrary changes to how political systems behave

**Meaning:**
Systems follow transparent rules; cause → effect is understandable.

### Player Safety & Respect

- No harassment, intimidation, or targeted abuse
- No discrimination or hate content
- No doxxing, real-world targeting, or personal attacks

**Meaning:**
Players engage in political simulation — not personal aggression.

### Ethical Boundaries

- Strict separation between in-game politics and real-world politics
- No real-world persuasion, mobilisation, recruitment, or ideological promotion
- No exploitation of sensitive political issues

**Meaning:**
Political Sphere simulates — it does not influence real-world politics.

### Transparency & Accountability

- Rules and moderation criteria are visible
- Decisions explained when possible
- Appeals processes exist
- Audit trails for sensitive actions

**Meaning:**
Trust is built through openness and clear reasoning.

### Accessibility & Inclusion

- Game systems and UI support broad participation
- Features do not exclude based on ability, background, or identity
- Assistive features when possible (within resource constraints)

**Meaning:**
Players of different abilities and experiences can succeed.

### Player Agency With Consequence

- Players have meaningful strategic freedom
- Conduct and decisions carry in-world outcomes
- Leadership roles earned through conduct, not purchased

**Meaning:**
Power in the game is earned and accountable.

### Civic Duty Simulation

- We expose players to the pressures, trade-offs, and responsibilities of leadership — not just power and winning. Learning to govern responsibly is the central educational purpose of Political Sphere.

**Meaning:**
This distinguishes the platform from politics-as-content games: we teach civic duty, restraint, and institutional stewardship.

### Responsible Use of AI

- AI supports gameplay, moderation, and simulation
- No manipulation or psychological influence
- Local models only; transparent guardrails
- Human override for moderation decisions

**Meaning:**
AI enhances the world, but never controls real-world beliefs or behaviour.

### Continuous Improvement

- Systems evolve while maintaining core fairness
- Feedback loops with players
- Ethical review of changes
- Change logs and decision documentation

**Meaning:**
The game grows, but values remain stable.

## Dual-Layer Values

To make governance and operational changes easier to manage, we separate enduring constitutional values from adaptive operational principles:

- 🌱 Enduring Constitutional Values

  - No real-world political influence
  - Safety & dignity
  - Fairness
  - Accessibility & inclusion

- ⚙️ Adaptive Operational Principles
  - Weekly community ethics sync
  - Transparent moderation logs
  - Audit trails and ABAC (attribute-based access control)
  - Zero-cost governance tooling

This structure keeps the constitution stable while allowing operations to evolve.

## 🛡️ Ethical Framework

### Explicit Prohibitions

No pay-to-win

No political ads

No monetising personal data

No external political campaigning

No use of real politicians/parties as mechanics

No behavioural-influence systems including nudging, emotional profiling, or targeted content designed to shape political behaviour.

No dark patterns

### Behaviour Standards

Build and play respectfully

Challenge ideas, not people

Follow structured debate rules

Report misconduct responsibly

Accept outcomes and appeals process

Maintain anonymity/privacy boundaries

Act to preserve simulation integrity

### Alignment Statements

Game-world integrity over speed of development

Ethics precede growth

Community trust is a core asset

Security and safety > convenience

Design choices must preserve fairness and equal access

We do not take political positions. We curate process, fairness, and pluralism.

Zero pipeline between in-game actions and real-world politics.

Ethics should empower responsible velocity, not impede progress. Where principles and speed conflict, escalate fast — ethics does not mean paralysis.

### AI Ethics Principles

#### 🤖 Human-Centric AI

**AI serves human needs and enhances human capabilities, never replaces human judgment in democratic processes.**

**Requirements:**

- All AI recommendations include human oversight options
- Users can always access unfiltered information alongside AI summaries
- AI tools are designed to educate, not persuade or manipulate
- Regular human review of AI-generated content for contextual appropriateness

#### 📊 Data Ethics

**We collect, process, and use data responsibly, respecting individual privacy and collective benefit.**

**Requirements:**

- GDPR compliance with additional privacy protections for political data
- Data minimization: collect only what's necessary for educational purposes
- Transparent data usage with user consent and control
- Regular privacy impact assessments for new features

**Player Identity Protection:** We never infer, predict, or classify a player's real-world political beliefs, affiliations, or voting intentions. Such profiling is prohibited and treated as high-risk under our governance.

#### 🔍 Algorithmic Transparency

**Users understand how our AI works and can verify its outputs independently.**

**Requirements:**

- Open-source core algorithms where legally permissible
- Clear explanations of AI decision-making processes
- Ability for users to challenge and correct AI outputs
- Regular third-party audits of algorithmic fairness

#### 🧾 AI Provenance & Verifiability

Any generated political claim or consequential content must include provenance: links to verifiable data, primary sources, or clearly documented derivations. We prioritise reproducible assertions and require source references for claims used in educational contexts.

#### 🛡️ Anti-Manipulation Standard

No AI or game system may be designed to change real-world beliefs, voting behaviour, or political identity. If a mechanic or output could plausibly persuade in real life, it cannot be used in the game.

### Political Simulation Ethics

#### 🎭 Simulation Integrity

**Our simulations accurately represent political processes while clearly distinguishing reality from simulation.**

**Requirements:**

- All simulations based on verified historical and current data
- Clear disclaimers about simulation limitations and assumptions
- Educational framing that teaches critical thinking about models
- Regular validation against real-world political outcomes

#### ⚖️ Neutrality Standards

**We present diverse political perspectives fairly and encourage critical thinking over partisanship.**

**Requirements:**

- Balanced representation of political viewpoints in content
- Fact-checking of all political claims regardless of source
- Tools to help users evaluate information quality
- Avoidance of algorithmic personalization that creates echo chambers

#### 🌍 Global Responsibility

**Our work considers global impacts and respects diverse political and cultural contexts.**

**Requirements:**

- Content localization that respects local political contexts
- Consideration of international human rights standards
- Avoidance of content that could incite violence or division
- Support for democratic processes worldwide
