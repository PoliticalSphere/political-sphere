## 🎯 Objectives

- Systematically identify potential threats to the platform.
- Prioritize mitigation efforts based on risk assessment.
- Integrate threat modeling into development and architecture reviews.
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of security, privacy, and ethical concerns.

## 🧭 STRIDE Methodology

STRIDE categorizes threats into six types: **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation Disclosure, **D**enial of Service, **E**levation of Privilege.

### Threat Categories

| Category | Description | Examples in Political Sphere |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **Spoofing** | Impersonating users or systems | Fake user accounts, AI spoofing as human moderators |
| **Tampering** | Modifying data or systems | Altering vote counts, injecting malicious code in debates |
| **Repudiation** | Denying actions | Users denying submitted speeches, AI denying generated content |
| **Information Disclosure** | Exposing sensitive data | Leaking user PII, revealing AI prompts |
| **Denial of Service** | Disrupting availability | Flooding debates with spam, overwhelming servers |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorized access | Escalating from player to admin, bypassing moderation |

## 📋 Threat Modeling Process

1. **Define Scope:** Identify system components (e.g., GraphQL API, AI orchestrator, database).
2. **Identify Threats:** Use STRIDE to brainstorm threats for each component.
3. **Assess Risks:** Evaluate likelihood and impact using [Risk Appetite and Matrix](risk-appetite-and-matrix.md).
4. **Mitigate:** Design controls (e.g., authentication, encryption, logging).
5. **Validate:** Test mitigations and update models.

### Example Threat Model: Debate System

| Component | Threat (STRIDE) | Risk Score | Mitigation |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Debate Queue | Tampering (vote rigging) | 15 (High) | Server-side validation, audit logs |
| Debate Queue | DoS (spam flooding) | 12 (High) | Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, moderation |
| AI NPC | Spoofing (fake human) | 10 (High) | Transparency labels, human oversight |
| User Speech | Information Disclosure (PII leak) | 12 (High) | Content scanning, anonymization |
| Vote Tally | Repudiation (deny vote) | 9 (Medium) | Immutable logs, digital signatures |

## 🛠️ Tools and Templates

- **Diagrams:** Use Mermaid or Draw.io for data flow diagrams.
- **Templates:** Standard STRIDE worksheet in [threat-model-template.md](../templates/threat-model-template.md).
- **Integration:** Conduct modeling during ADRs, sprint planning, and code reviews.

## 📊 Key Threats for Political Sphere

### High-Priority Threats
- **AI Ethical Misuse:** Elevation of privilege via prompt injection to manipulate simulations.
- **Data Privacy Breaches:** Information disclosure of user identities or debate content.
- **Platform Manipulation:** Tampering with votes or debates to skew outcomes.
- **Service Disruption:** DoS attacks on realtime features during high-stakes sessions.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement zero-trust architecture.
- Use encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring.
- Conduct regular penetration testing.
