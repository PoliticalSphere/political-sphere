# AI-ASSISTABLE METADATA TEMPLATE
# ==============================================================================
# This template demonstrates the structured metadata format for GitHub Actions
# workflows, enabling machine comprehension by AI tools, automated governance,
# and intelligent workflow analysis.
#
# USAGE:
# Copy this header block to the top of each workflow file and fill in values.
# All fields prefixed with @ are machine-parseable metadata.
