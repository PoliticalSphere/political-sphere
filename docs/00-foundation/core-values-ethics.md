## 🌟 Core Values

### Fairness

All players operate on equal terms

No paid advantages or influence

Rules are applied consistently

Server-authoritative simulation

**Meaning:**
Outcome is earned through in-world conduct, strategy, and relationships — not money, manipulation, or privilege.

### Integrity of Simulation

The game world behaves consistently and predictably

Parliamentary processes work as rules-based systems

No arbitrary changes to how political systems behave

**Meaning:**
Systems follow transparent rules; cause → effect is understandable.

### Player Safety & Respect

No harassment, intimidation, or targeted abuse

No discrimination or hate content

No doxxing, real-world targeting, or personal attacks

**Meaning:**
Players engage in political simulation — not personal aggression.

### Ethical Boundaries

Strict separation between in-game politics and real-world politics

No real-world persuasion, mobilisation, recruitment, or ideological promotion

No exploitation of sensitive political issues

**Meaning:**
Political Sphere simulates — it does not influence real-world politics.

### Transparency & Accountability

Rules and moderation criteria are visible

Decisions explained when possible

Appeals processes exist

Audit trails for sensitive actions

**Meaning:**
Trust is built through openness and clear reasoning.

### Accessibility & Inclusion

Game systems and UI support broad participation

Features do not exclude based on ability, background, or identity

Assistive features when possible (within resource constraints)

**Meaning:**
Players of different abilities and experiences can succeed.

### Player Agency With Consequence

Players have meaningful strategic freedom

Conduct and decisions carry in-world outcomes

Leadership roles earned through conduct, not purchased

**Meaning:**
Power in the game is earned and accountable.

### Responsible Use of AI

AI supports gameplay, moderation, and simulation

No manipulation or psychological influence

Local models only; transparent guardrails

Human override for moderation decisions

**Meaning:**
AI enhances the world, but never controls real-world beliefs or behaviour.

### Continuous Improvement

Systems evolve while maintaining core fairness

Feedback loops with players

Ethical review of changes

Change logs and decision documentation

**Meaning:**
The game grows, but values remain stable.
