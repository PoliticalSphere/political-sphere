## 🎯 Domain Collaboration Highlights

- **Gameplay Loop:** Players interact via GraphQL and realtime channels → Parliamentary Core manages motions/divisions → Debate & Chambers broadcast updates → Media & Narrative generates summaries.
- **AI Assistance:** AI Simulation orchestrator consumes events from NATS, calls provider-specific adapters, applies safety filters, and returns responses through GraphQL mutations/subscriptions.
- **Moderation:** Safety & Moderation context exposes restricted REST endpoints for case handling; escalations trigger audit events and transparency reports.
- **Compliance:** Audit store receives append-only events from every mutation; Admin/Compliance tooling exports reports via dedicated REST endpoints.

## 📎 Next Layers

- Level 3 component diagrams live alongside each context (see domain-specific docs).
- Sequence diagrams for debate/vote flow and AI moderation pipeline reside in `docs/07-ai-and-simulation/` and `docs/08-game-design-and-mechanics/`.

Keep these diagrams updated alongside ADRs and major architectural changes to preserve shared understanding.
