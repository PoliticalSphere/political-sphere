## Recommended next steps for Efficiency Best-Practices

These next steps are required per the governance Meta-Rule (add TODO entries with owners and due dates). Please complete or reassign as needed.

1. CI integration for guard script

   - Owner: @ci-team
   - Due: 2025-11-10
   - Description: Add a GitHub Actions job to run `tools/scripts/ai/guard-change-budget.mjs --mode=${{ inputs.mode }} --base=origin/main` on PRs and pre-merge checks. Validate on a draft PR and ensure clear diagnostics on failure.

2. Notify governance & docs owners

   - Owner: @docs-team
   - Due: 2025-11-07
   - Description: Announce the Efficiency Best-Practices update and the new TODO update requirement to governance owners and the `#governance` channel. Provide an example TODO entry and explain `FAST_AI` behaviour.

3. Add example PR snippet and FAST_AI guidance

   - Owner: @devops-team
   - Due: 2025-11-06
   - Description: Add a short example to the PR templates and contributor docs showing how to declare `AI-EXECUTION` headers, list deferred gates, and indicate when `FAST_AI=1` was used for development runs.

4. Close-files policy rollout

   - Owner: @ai-team
   - Due: 2025-11-07
   - Description: Ensure agent tooling and editor snippets instruct agents to close files after edits (close buffers/tabs). Update agent wrappers and automation to close editor files or log file handles after use.

   ## MCP Stubs Added (2025-11-03)

   - [x] Created minimal MCP server stubs in `apps/dev/mcp-servers/*/src/index.ts` for: filesystem, github, git, puppeteer, sqlite, political-sphere. These are simple HTTP servers exposing `/health` and `/info` to validate local MCP wiring and VSCode/Client integration during development and testing.

   Owner: @devops-team
   Due: 2025-11-10
   Description: Review these stubs and replace with production MCP implementations or remove if upstream servers are restored. Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and database artifacts are secured when enabling GitHub/SQLite MCPs in CI/dev environments.

   Notes:

   - Backups of the original, corrupted entrypoints were saved alongside the sources as `src/index.corrupted.txt` in each affected package.
   - Ephemeral runtime artifacts (logs and PID files) were written to `/tmp/mcp-<name>.log` and `/tmp/mcp-<name>.pid` during the verification run. These can be used to reproduce the quick health checks performed during the session.

   - [x] Repair original `src/index.ts` entrypoints and restore canonical implementations (or formally adopt the `src/dev-server.ts` dev entrypoints):

     - Owner: @devops-team
     - Done: 2025-11-04
     - Description: Repaired `src/index.ts` for the following MCP packages and restored the `dev` script to run `src/index.ts`:
       - `filesystem` (port 4010)
       - `github` (port 4011)
       - `git` (port 4012)
       - `puppeteer` (port 4013)
       - `sqlite` (port 4014)
       - `political-sphere` (port 4015)
     - Notes: Backups kept at `src/index.corrupted.txt`. Ephemeral logs and PIDs are in `/tmp/mcp-<name>.log` and `/tmp/mcp-<name>.pid`.

5. Provision local test runners

   - Owner: @devops-team
   - Due: 2025-11-10
   - Description: Add `vitest` or `jest` to devDependencies in `package.json` and ensure CI images run `npm ci`. This enables `scripts/ci/check-tools.mjs` to detect the runner locally and avoids requiring networked `npx` checks in CI.

### Tool-usage rule rollout (2025-11-03)

- [x] Add mandatory tool-usage guidance to governance files and agent prompts
  - Owner: @ai-team
  - Due: 2025-11-07
  - Description: Require agents to identify and invoke appropriate workspace tools for a task (code search, semantic search, `read_file`, test runners, linters, guard script, indexers). If a required tool is unavailable, agents must document the failure in the PR and create a `/docs/TODO.md` entry. Updated `.vscode/agent-prompts.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `ai/governance/.blackboxrules`.

## Recent: Test discovery stabilisation (2025-11-04)

- [x] Converted remaining `node:test` style tests to Vitest-compatible tests (used `vitest` imports and `expect`) across `apps/*` and mirrored `tools/*` test folders. This resolves Vitest test discovery failures and multiple flaky suites caused by Node test harness usage.

Owner: @devs-team
Status: Completed (2025-11-04)
Next steps:

- Open a draft PR with these changes and include `AI-EXECUTION: mode: Safe` header; assign reviewers from core-maintainers and testing owners.
- Run full CI preflight on the PR (ensure guard-change-budget script passes) and address any lint/type warnings that appear.
- If any remaining flakiness is observed in CI, add specific flaky test entries to this TODO list with owner and due date.

## Recent: Microsoft Learn context added (2025-11-04)

- Files added by assistant to provide authoritative context and onboarding references:
  - `apps/docs/compliance/responsible-ai.md` — Responsible AI references and checklist (Microsoft Learn links)
  - `apps/docs/security/identity-and-access.md` — Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), RBAC guidance and practical recommendations
  - `apps/docs/observability/opentelemetry.md` — Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry quickstart and guidance

Owner: @docs-team
Status: Completed (drafts)
Notes: These are initial, curated references sourced from Microsoft Learn. Review and expand the content to include project-specific implementation steps and internal compliance artefacts where needed.

### File placement enforcement (2025-11-03)

- [x] Implement CI script to validate directory placements
  - Owner: @ci-team
  - Due: 2025-11-10

# Political Sphere Project Context

## Overview

Political Sphere is a democratically-governed political simulation platform. The current codebase focuses on a lightweight gameplay loop, compliance tooling, and auditing of AI interventions. The repository is organised as a multi-package workspace with a mixture of JavaScript and TypeScript services rather than a fully-generated Nx environment.

## Active Components

- **API Service (`apps/api`)**  
  Plain Node.js HTTP server that exposes JSON endpoints for political entities (users, parties, bills, votes). Persistence relies on SQLite via `better-sqlite3`, with hand-written migration files.
- **Game Server (`apps/game-server`)**  
  Express application that maintains in-memory game state, persists snapshots to SQLite, and brokers content moderation/age verification flows.
- **Frontend Shell (`apps/frontend`)**  
  Static-serving Node.js server that renders a React dashboard from prebuilt assets in `apps/frontend/public`, enriching the template with live API data at request time.

## Supporting Libraries

- **`libs/shared`** – Precompiled CommonJS utilities (logging, security helpers, telemetry adapters) consumed by the runtime services.
- **`libs/game-engine`** – Turn progression helpers referenced by the game server.
- Additional libraries (`libs/platform`, `libs/ui`, …) are in-progress scaffolding and may contain TypeScript sources that are not part of the active runtime.

## Data & Storage

- Primary store: SQLite databases that live under `apps/api/data/` and `apps/game-server/data/`.
- Migrations: `apps/api/src/migrations/` contains sequential SQL/JS migration scripts plus validation helpers.
- Observability: Structured logging funnels through `libs/shared/logger`. No central metrics stack is wired up yet; AI-facing metrics are JSON files under `ai/`.

## Tooling & Build

- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 18 with ECMAScript modules enabled for most services.
- **Package management**: Root `package-lock.json` pins dependencies; many packages are marked `extraneous`, so prefer `npm install` at the repository root to hydrate `node_modules/`.
- **Nx configuration**: `tools/config/nx.json` exists for future modular orchestration, but the current workflow relies on direct `node` invocations and a handful of ad-hoc scripts.
- **Testing**: Jest-style unit tests and Node test runners are present but not yet wired into a single command. Accessibility tests use Playwright under `apps/frontend/tests/`.

## Governance & Compliance

- `.blackboxrules` (under `ai/governance/`) and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` define binding AI behaviour.
- Compliance scripts under `apps/game-server/scripts/` exercise age verification, logging, and moderation flows.
- `ai-controls.json` at the repository root centralises rate limits, quality gates, and monitoring expectations for AI automation.
- Audit trails and interaction logs belong in `ai/history/` (see README and templates).

## Key Directories

- `ai/` – AI-facing documentation, indexes, patterns, and governance rules.
- `ai/context-bundles/` – Auto-generated, high-signal context packs for rapid loading.
- `apps/` – Runtime services (`api`, `frontend`, `game-server`) plus scaffolding for dev tooling.
- `libs/` – Shared runtime logic; many packages export transpiled JS alongside TypeScript sources.
- `docs/` – Authoritative policies, controls, and architecture notes.
- `tools/` – Automation scripts, CI helpers, and the dormant Nx configuration.

## AI Assistant Expectations

- Load this context together with `ai/ai-knowledge/architecture-overview.md` before making changes.
- Work within zero-trust, accessibility-first constraints; never bypass `.blackboxrules`.
- Prefer small, auditable changes; document non-obvious decisions in `ai/history/`.
- Start from the relevant quick reference (`ai/ai-knowledge/api-service.md`, etc.) or context bundle before diving into source.
- Raise a TODO in `docs/TODO.md` if you defer required gates or discover gaps that need human follow-up.

For deeper architectural questions, inspect the service-specific READMEs or architectural ADRs under `docs/04-architecture/`.
