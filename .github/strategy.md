# Strategic & Lifecycle Governance

## Roadmap Alignment

Connect changes to strategy: Verify alignment with project roadmap. Incorporate stakeholder input. Conduct ethics reviews for sensitive features. Use transparent prioritization. Document strategic decisions in ADRs.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Document significant technical choices:

- **Location** → `/docs/architecture/decisions/`
- **Format** → Context, decision, consequences, alternatives considered
- **When** → Technology choices, architectural patterns, critical trade-offs

**Create ADR for:** Introducing new dependencies. Changing system architecture. Adopting new patterns/practices. Security/privacy design choices.

## Deprecation Policy

Sunset features responsibly: **Announce** (90 days advance notice minimum). **Migrate** (provide clear migration paths). **Support** (help users transition). **Sunset** (remove with clear timeline). **Clean up** (eliminate technical debt).

## Risk Management

Proactively manage risks: **Risk Register** (centralized tracking). **Risk Owners** (assigned accountability). **Mitigations** (documented strategies). **Reviews** (quarterly assessments). **Escalation** (high-severity risks to leadership).

## Mission Alignment

Serve democratic goals: Define KPIs/OKRs linked to mission outcomes. Assess unintended consequences. Monitor for mission drift. Ensure features advance democratic engagement. Conduct regular impact assessments.

## Continuous Maturity

Always improve: Learn from incidents, failures, and successes. Adopt industry best practices. Refresh standards quarterly. Invest in technical excellence. Foster culture of learning and experimentation.
