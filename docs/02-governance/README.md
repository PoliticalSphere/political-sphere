## 🎯 Objectives

- Establish clear separation between platform authority and player simulation governance.
- Ensure transparent, fair, and accountable decision-making processes.
- Protect player safety and maintain ethical boundaries in political simulation.
- Enable player autonomy within the fictional world while safeguarding real-world rights.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Fairness First:** Consistent rules, equal treatment, no favoritism.
- **Transparency:** All decisions documented, visible, and explainable.
- **Accountability:** Actions traceable; power justified and auditable.
- **Separation of Powers:** Platform authority protects real people; player authority governs the fictional world.
- **Player Autonomy with Limits:** Strong in-game agency, zero real-world political influence.
- **Safety and Dignity:** Zero tolerance for harm, harassment, or real-world mobilization.
- **Procedural Legitimacy:** Rules follow process, not arbitrary decisions.
- **Appeal Rights:** Error correction is part of justice.
- **No Ideology or Agenda:** Simulation without real-world political persuasion.

## 🏛️ Governance Structure

### Platform Governance (Real Authority)
Responsible for real-world platform safety, rules, moderation oversight, and feature decisions.

- **Composition:** Developers/administrators with community representatives.
- **Responsibilities:** Policy creation, moderation oversight, feature decisions, safety enforcement.
- **Key Features:** Transparent policy changes, community input encouraged, dev team final say (ethical guardrail).
- **Audit Trails:** For power use (bans, sanctions, world resets).
- **Purpose:** Protects players, not factions.

### In-Game Governance (Simulation Authority)
Players govern the fictional parliament and game world, not the platform.

- **Scope:** Speaker/Presiding Officer roles, party leaders, whips, committees, election cycles, parliamentary procedure rules.
- **Limitations:** Purely in-world; never affects platform rights or real-world consequences.

### Constitutional Framework
Two-layer structure ensuring stability and adaptability:

| Layer | Purpose | Update Process |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Platform Constitution | Player rights, safety, fairness, moderation, privacy | Governance Council approval, community consultation |
| Game Constitution | How fictional parliament operates | Player votes, committee review |

Both are documented, versioned, change-logged, appealable, and reviewable.

## 🛡️ Moderation Policies

### Core Principles
- Protect players above all else.
- Intent matters, but impact matters more.
- No harassment, threats, hate, personal abuse.
- No real-world political advocacy, propaganda, or recruitment.
- Debate ideas, not identities.

### Moderation Process
1. **Reporting:** Players submit reports via in-game tools.
2. **Triage:** Human moderators review (AI assists only).
3. **Investigation:** Context gathering and evidence review.
4. **Decision:** Proportionate sanctions (warnings → mutes → removal).
5. **Communication:** Reasons provided; appeal rights explained.
6. **Appeals:** Reviewed by separate moderator or governance panel.

### Transparency Measures
- Reasons provided wherever possible.
- Anonymous summary logs of moderation actions (privacy-safe).
- Regular fairness reviews and bias audits.

### AI in Moderation
- AI assists triage and pattern detection only.
- No AI-only moderation decisions.
- All AI suggestions logged and reviewable by humans.

## ⚖️ Decision-Making Processes

### Platform Decisions
Structured ADR (Architectural Decision Record) process:
1. **Proposal:** Documented RFC with rationale.
2. **Review:** Ethical & fairness checklist, player impact evaluation.
3. **Approval:** Governance Council vote.
4. **Implementation:** Changelog entry, publish rationale.
5. **Monitoring:** Post-implementation review.

### Game World Decisions
Players decide in-game rules through democratic processes:
- Motions and amendments in parliament.
- Votes in chamber with quorum requirements.
- Party processes and caucuses.
- Constitutional committees for major changes.

### Override Authority
Platform retains override right only for:
- Ethics violations
- Fairness risks
- Safety threats
- Legal compliance issues

Overrides must be documented publicly with justification.

---

## 📊 Accountability Systems

- **Audit Logs:** Sensitive actions (bans, vote changes, role appointments) logged immutably.
- **Historical Records:** Immutable world event logs for transparency.
- **Change Tracking:** Transparent rule updates with version control.
- **Ethics Checklists:** Required for significant changes.
- **Periodic Reviews:** Quarterly governance effectiveness assessments.

## 👥 Player Governance Roles

| Role | Function | Selection | Term |
|------|----------|-----------|------|
| Speaker | Keeps order, enforces fictional rules | Elected by parliament | 1 session |
| MPs | Debate, vote, legislate (in-world) | Elected by constituencies | 4 years |
| Party Leaders | Organise factions, set strategy | Party internal election | Variable |
| Whips | Enforce party alignment (in-world) | Appointed by leaders | Variable |
| Committees | Review fictional misconduct or procedures | Appointed/selected | Variable |

**Critical Note:** Player governance affects only in-world consequences. It cannot punish players outside the game simulation or influence real-world rights.

---

## 🚨 Safety Hard Lines

Platform immediately intervenes (bypassing normal processes) if:
- Harassment, bullying, or threats occur.
- Personal information exposed.
- Identity-based hostility appears.
- Real-world political mobilization attempted.
- Extremist content or manipulation detected.

These are non-negotiable, real-world policy triggers requiring immediate action.

---

## 🛡️ Ethics and Protection

- **Pseudonymity:** Default anonymous identities to protect real-world privacy.
- **Content Boundaries:** No real-world ideology discussion or persuasion.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Regular bias awareness training for moderators.
- **Appeals Process:** Always available, reviewed by independent parties.
- **Data Ethics:** No monetization, profiling, or political data exploitation.
