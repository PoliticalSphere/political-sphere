## 🎯 Objectives

- Decouple bounded contexts, AI orchestration, and analytics through reliable event streams.
- Provide clear contracts, schemas, and governance for domain events.
- Enable observability and replay for debugging, audits, and simulation tuning.

## 🧱 Event Platform

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
| --------- | ------- | ----- |
| **NATS JetStream** | Primary event bus for domain events | At-least-once delivery, ordered streams per subject |
| **Redis Streams (Fallback)** | Low-latency transient events (realtime presence) | Used for debate presence/typing indicators |
| **Kafka (Future)** | High-throughput analytics and long-term event storage | Evaluate when load >50k events/sec sustained |

## 🔔 Key Event Streams

| Subject | Producer | Consumers | Purpose |
| ------- | -------- | --------- | ------- |
| `debate.started` | Parliamentary Core | Realtime gateway, Media, AI agents | Begin debate workflow |
| `debate.ended` | Parliamentary Core | Realtime gateway, Media, Analytics | End debate, log transcript |
| `vote.division_opened` | Parliamentary Core | Realtime gateway, AI agents | Start vote collection |
| `vote.cast` | Parliamentary Core | Realtime gateway, Moderation, Analytics | Record individual vote |
| `vote.division_closed` | Parliamentary Core | Realtime gateway, Media, AI | Finalize tally, broadcast result |
| `moderation.flagged` | Safety & Moderation | Admin console, Audit log, Notification service | Alert moderators, track appeals |

## 🧾 Event Contract Standards

- Naming: `context.entity.eventName.v1` (e.g., `parliament.motionScheduled.v1`).
- Schema: Zod definitions stored in `libs/events/<context>` and published to registry.
- Envelope:
  ```ts
  type EventEnvelope<T> = {
    id: string;
    schemaVersion: string;
    occurredAt: string;
    emittedBy: string;
    tenantId: string;
    traceId: string;
    payload: T;
    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
  ```
- Idempotency: Consumers enforce idempotency via event `id`; producers guarantee monotonic ordering per aggregate.
- Security: JWT-based publisher auth; sensitive payload fields encrypted when necessary (e.g., moderation evidence).

## 🔄 Replay & Observability

- **Event Store:** JetStream streams retain events for 90 days; snapshots exported to object storage monthly for audit continuity.
- **Replay Tooling:** `pnpm run events:replay --subject=parliament.divisionRecorded --from=2025-01-01` replays events into staging for debugging or AI re-evaluation.
- **Tracing:** `traceId` propagated from HTTP/WebSocket requests; telemetry ties events to user actions and AI decisions.
- **Metrics:** Publish `event_lag_seconds`, `consumer_backlog`, `delivery_failures`; alerts configured when lag >5 s or failure rate >0.1%.

## 📎 Governance

- Event versioning documented in [Versioning & Deprecation Policy](../api-architecture/versioning-and-deprecation-policy.md).
- New events require ADR or RFC referencing domain intent, schema, and consumers.
- Breaking changes follow announce → dual-write → consumers migrate → retire cadence.

Eventing is the nervous system of Political Sphere—keep contracts explicit, observable, and well-governed.
