## 🎯 Objectives

- Define the organization's tolerance for risk across different categories.
- Provide a consistent framework for risk assessment and prioritization.
- Ensure risks are managed in alignment with ethical, legal, and operational goals.
- Support decision-making by quantifying risk levels and acceptable thresholds.

## 🧭 Risk Appetite Statement

Political Sphere accepts risks that are necessary to achieve its mission of providing a credible, fair, and ethical political simulation, while strictly avoiding risks that could compromise user safety, data privacy, or platform integrity. We prioritize prevention of high-impact risks related to user harm, legal non-compliance, and AI misuse, even at the cost of slower development or increased operational complexity.

**Key Thresholds:**
- **Intolerable:** Risks that could lead to user harm, legal violations, or platform shutdown (e.g., data breaches exposing PII, AI manipulation of users).
- **Tolerable with Mitigation:** Risks that can be managed through controls, with regular monitoring (e.g., minor vulnerabilities, operational disruptions).
- **Acceptable:** Low-impact risks that align with zero-budget constraints and ethical boundaries (e.g., minor feature delays).

## 📊 Risk Assessment Matrix

Risks are evaluated based on **Likelihood** and **Impact**, using a 5x5 matrix. Scores determine priority and response strategy.

| Likelihood | Description | Score |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Very Low | Unlikely to occur (<5% chance) | 1 |
| Low | Possible but rare (5-20% chance) | 2 |
| Medium | Could happen (20-50% chance) | 3 |
| High | Likely to occur (50-80% chance) | 4 |
| Very High | Almost certain (>80% chance) | 5 |

| Impact | Description | Score |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| Very Low | Minimal effect on operations/users | 1 |
| Low | Minor disruption, easily recoverable | 2 |
| Medium | Noticeable impact, requires effort to fix | 3 |
| High | Significant harm to users/platform, legal issues | 4 |
| Very High | Catastrophic failure, platform shutdown | 5 |

### Risk Levels and Actions

| Risk Score (L x I) | Level | Action |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------ |
| 1-4 | Low | Accept; monitor periodically |
| 5-9 | Medium | Mitigate with controls; review quarterly |
| 10-15 | High | Mitigate aggressively; implement compensating controls |
| 16-25 | Critical | Avoid or transfer; immediate action required |

## 📈 Risk Management Process

1. **Identification:** Use threat modeling, audits, and stakeholder input.
2. **Assessment:** Apply matrix to determine level and priority.
3. **Response:** Choose from avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept.
4. **Monitoring:** Track in [Risk Register](risk-register.md); review quarterly.
5. **Reporting:** Update Security Council and stakeholders.
