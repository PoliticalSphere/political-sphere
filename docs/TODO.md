## Overview

Implement governance reforms to reduce bureaucracy while preserving quality, security, and compliance value. Focus on AI-driven automation, proportional oversight, and efficiency improvements.

## Tasks

### 1. Execution Mode Reforms

- [x] Update execution modes with AI-driven automation and risk-based scaling
- [x] Increase Fast-Secure budget to 200 lines/8 files for small features
- [x] Automate 90% of quality gates in Safe mode
- [x] Enhance AI suggestions and automated safety checks in R&D mode

### 2. Proportional Governance

- [x] Apply governance proportionally - lighter for small changes, stricter for critical paths
- [x] Focus human review on architectural decisions and high-risk areas
- [x] Add automated follow-up reminders for deferred gates

### 3. Efficiency Best-Practices Integration

- [x] Embed efficiency patterns directly into workflows to reduce friction
- [x] Use AI to suggest optimal approaches rather than enforcing rigid rules
- [x] Provide smart defaults for common development tasks

### 4. Documentation Updates

- [x] Update rule files with new execution modes and budgets
- [x] Ensure parity between .blackboxrules and copilot-instructions.md

### 5. Validation and Final Checks

- [ ] Test updated execution modes in CI pipeline
- [ ] Validate that reforms reduce development friction while maintaining quality
- [ ] Monitor adoption and gather feedback from development team
- [ ] Update any cross-references if needed

## Notes

- All documents should include document control metadata at the bottom.
- Content should be accessible, inclusive, and follow plain language principles.
- Consider AI/ML and political simulation specific examples where relevant.
- Potential risks: Legal review may be needed for sensitive policies; flag if content touches on unapproved areas.

## Recommended next steps for Efficiency Best-Practices

These next steps are required per the governance Meta-Rule (add TODO entries with owners and due dates). Please complete or reassign as needed.

1. CI integration for guard script

   - Owner: @ci-team
   - Due: 2025-11-10
   - Description: Add a GitHub Actions job to run `tools/scripts/ai/guard-change-budget.mjs --mode=${{ inputs.mode }} --base=origin/main` on PRs and pre-merge checks. Validate on a draft PR and ensure clear diagnostics on failure.

2. Notify governance & docs owners

   - Owner: @docs-team
   - Due: 2025-11-07
   - Description: Announce the Efficiency Best-Practices update and the new TODO update requirement to governance owners and the `#governance` channel. Provide an example TODO entry and explain `FAST_AI` behaviour.

3. Add example PR snippet and FAST_AI guidance

   - Owner: @devops-team
   - Due: 2025-11-06
   - Description: Add a short example to the PR templates and contributor docs showing how to declare `AI-EXECUTION` headers, list deferred gates, and indicate when `FAST_AI=1` was used for development runs.

4. Close-files policy rollout

   - Owner: @ai-team
   - Due: 2025-11-07
   - Description: Ensure agent tooling and editor snippets instruct agents to close files after edits (close buffers/tabs). Update agent wrappers and automation to close editor files or log file handles after use.

   ## MCP Stubs Added (2025-11-03)

   - [x] Created minimal MCP server stubs in `apps/dev/mcp-servers/*/src/index.ts` for: filesystem, github, git, puppeteer, sqlite, political-sphere. These are simple HTTP servers exposing `/health` and `/info` to validate local MCP wiring and VSCode/Client integration during development and testing.

   Owner: @devops-team
   Due: 2025-11-10
   Description: Review these stubs and replace with production MCP implementations or remove if upstream servers are restored. Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and database artifacts are secured when enabling GitHub/SQLite MCPs in CI/dev environments.

   Notes:

   - Backups of the original, corrupted entrypoints were saved alongside the sources as `src/index.corrupted.txt` in each affected package.
   - Ephemeral runtime artifacts (logs and PID files) were written to `/tmp/mcp-<name>.log` and `/tmp/mcp-<name>.pid` during the verification run. These can be used to reproduce the quick health checks performed during the session.

   - [x] Repair original `src/index.ts` entrypoints and restore canonical implementations (or formally adopt the `src/dev-server.ts` dev entrypoints):

     - Owner: @devops-team
     - Done: 2025-11-04
     - Description: Repaired `src/index.ts` for the following MCP packages and restored the `dev` script to run `src/index.ts`:
       - `filesystem` (port 4010)
       - `github` (port 4011)
       - `git` (port 4012)
       - `puppeteer` (port 4013)
       - `sqlite` (port 4014)
       - `political-sphere` (port 4015)
     - Notes: Backups kept at `src/index.corrupted.txt`. Ephemeral logs and PIDs are in `/tmp/mcp-<name>.log` and `/tmp/mcp-<name>.pid`.

5. Provision local test runners

   - Owner: @devops-team
   - Due: 2025-11-10
   - Description: Add `vitest` or `jest` to devDependencies in `package.json` and ensure CI images run `npm ci`. This enables `tools/scripts/ci/check-tools.mjs` to detect the runner locally and avoids requiring networked `npx` checks in CI.

### Tool-usage rule rollout (2025-11-03)

- [x] Add mandatory tool-usage guidance to governance files and agent prompts
  - Owner: @ai-team
  - Due: 2025-11-07
  - Description: Require agents to identify and invoke appropriate workspace tools for a task (code search, semantic search, `read_file`, test runners, linters, guard script, indexers). If a required tool is unavailable, agents must document the failure in the PR and create a `/docs/TODO.md` entry. Updated `.vscode/agent-prompts.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `ai/governance/.blackboxrules`.

## Recent: Microsoft Learn context added (2025-11-04)

- Files added by assistant to provide authoritative context and onboarding references:
  - `apps/docs/compliance/responsible-ai.md` — Responsible AI references and checklist (Microsoft Learn links)
  - `apps/docs/security/identity-and-access.md` — Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), RBAC guidance and practical recommendations
  - `apps/docs/observability/opentelemetry.md` — Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry quickstart and guidance

Owner: @docs-team
Status: Completed (drafts)
Notes: These are initial, curated references sourced from Microsoft Learn. Review and expand the content to include project-specific implementation steps and internal compliance artefacts where needed.

### File placement enforcement (2025-11-03)

- [x] Implement CI script to validate directory placements
  - Owner: @ci-team
  - Due: 2025-11-10
  - Description: Created `tools/scripts/ci/check-file-placement.mjs` to enforce governance directory rules. Added to guard-check.yml and affected-tests.yml workflows. Updated governance rules with enforcement mechanisms.
