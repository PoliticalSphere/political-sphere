# EU AI Act Compliance Evidence

## Overview

This document provides evidence of compliance with the EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) for AI systems deployed in the Political Sphere platform. The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk level and imposes corresponding requirements.

## AI System Classification

### High-Risk AI Systems (Article 6)

#### 1. AI Governance and Performance Monitoring

- **Classification**: High-risk (Annex III, point 1 - AI systems for risk assessment and scoring)
- **Purpose**: Automated evaluation and monitoring of AI system performance and ethical compliance
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Potential impact: Medium (affects system reliability and user trust)
  - Likelihood: Low (robust safeguards in place)
  - Risk Score: Low

#### 2. AI Code Generation and Review

- **Classification**: High-risk (Annex III, point 4a - AI systems for employment and workers management)
- **Purpose**: Automated code generation and review for software development
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Potential impact: High (affects software quality and security)
  - Likelihood: Medium (human oversight required)
  - Risk Score: Medium

### Limited-Risk AI Systems (Article 47)

#### 3. AI Learning and Adaptation

- **Classification**: Limited-risk
- **Purpose**: Continuous improvement of AI capabilities through feedback analysis
- **Transparency Requirements**: Met through logging and explainability features

#### 4. Self-Healing Automation

- **Classification**: Limited-risk
