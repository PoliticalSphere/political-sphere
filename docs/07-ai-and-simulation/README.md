## 🎯 Objectives

- Ensure AI systems enhance gameplay without compromising ethics, safety, or fairness.
- Provide transparent, accountable AI for NPC behaviors and moderation.
- Maintain zero-budget constraints using local, open-source models.
- Align AI usage with Political Sphere’s mission of credible, respectful simulation.

---

## 🧭 AI Principles

- **Ethical First:** AI must not persuade, manipulate, or reflect real-world ideologies.
- **Transparency:** All AI decisions are logged, explainable, and subject to human oversight.
- **Safety:** AI systems include guardrails against harmful content or biased outputs.
- **Local Focus:** Use self-hosted models (e.g., Ollama) to avoid external dependencies.
- **Human Oversight:** AI assists humans; humans retain final authority.
