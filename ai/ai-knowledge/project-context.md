# Political Sphere Project Context

## Overview
Political Sphere is a comprehensive simulation platform for political systems, governance, and policy modeling. It combines AI-driven simulations with web-based interfaces to explore political dynamics, decision-making processes, and societal outcomes.

## Key Components
- **AI Simulation Engine**: Core AI models for political behavior, policy impact analysis, and scenario prediction
- **Web Applications**: Frontend interfaces for visualization and interaction
- **API Services**: Backend services for data processing and simulation management
- **Data Layer**: Political data storage and analysis tools

## Architecture
- **Monorepo Structure**: Nx-based monorepo with multiple applications and libraries
- **Microservices**: Modular services for different political simulation aspects
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning models for predictive analytics and decision support

## Governance Rules
- **AI Learning**: Continuous improvement through interaction logging and pattern recognition
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Neutrality and transparency in political simulations
- **Security**: Comprehensive audit trails and access controls

## Development Practices
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with Jest and Playwright
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines with security scanning and compliance checks
