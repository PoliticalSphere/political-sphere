# ADR-0010: Zero-Trust Security Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Deciders:** Security Team, Technical Lead  
**Technical Story:** Security Architecture and Threat Model

## Context and Problem Statement

Political Sphere handles sensitive user data and democratic processes requiring the highest security standards. We need a security architecture that assumes breach and verifies every request.

## Decision Drivers

- Protection of sensitive political preference data
- Democratic integrity (prevent manipulation)
- Compliance with GDPR/CCPA
- Defense against sophisticated attacks
- Auditability and transparency

## Considered Options

- **Option 1**: Zero-trust architecture (verify everything)
- **Option 2**: Perimeter-based security (trusted internal network)
- **Option 3**: Hybrid approach (zero-trust for sensitive operations)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Zero-trust architecture (verify everything)"

**Justification:** Democratic platforms are high-value targets. Zero-trust ensures that even if one component is compromised, lateral movement is prevented. Every request is authenticated and authorized.

### Positive Consequences

- Maximum security posture
- Reduced blast radius from breaches
- Compliance-friendly (audit trails built-in)
- Supports microservices architecture
- Enables fine-grained access control

### Negative Consequences

- Increased latency (authentication overhead)
- More complex implementation
- Requires robust key management
- Higher operational overhead

## Security Controls

### Authentication

- JWT tokens with short expiry (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens with rotation
- Multi-factor authentication for admin actions
- No long-lived credentials

### Authorization

- Every request validated (no caching of permissions)
- Least privilege by default
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based policies for sensitive operations

### Encryption

- TLS 1.3+ for all transport
- AES-256-GCM for data at rest
- Ed25519 for signatures
- No plaintext secrets in code or config

### Input Validation

- Validate all inputs at API boundary
- Sanitize user content (XSS prevention)
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)

### Secrets Management

- AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault
- No secrets in source code (enforced by CI)
- Automatic rotation every 90 days
- Audit trail for secret access

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] **Security (SEC-01 to SEC-10)**: All controls implemented
- [x] **Privacy (COMP-01 to COMP-05)**: GDPR Article 32 compliance
- [x] **AI Governance (AIGOV-01 to AIGOV-07)**: Prevent AI manipulation
- [x] **Operations (OPS-01 to OPS-05)**: Security monitoring and alerts

## Notes

**Never:**

- Cache authorization decisions
- Skip authentication for "internal" APIs
- Store secrets in code or environment files
- Trust input without validation
- Disable security features (even temporarily)

**Always:**

- Verify JWT on every request
- Log security events (structured JSON)
- Apply rate limiting
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
