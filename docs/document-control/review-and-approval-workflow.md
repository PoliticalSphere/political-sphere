## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I determine which approval tier my document needs?

**A:** Use the risk assessment matrix. Consider regulatory impact, business criticality, stakeholder scope, and potential consequences of errors. When in doubt, select a higher tier.

### Q: What if a reviewer is unresponsive?

**A:** Wait 3 business days, then escalate to their manager. Document the delay and any impact on timeline. For urgent documents, request reviewer substitution.

### Q: Can I make changes during the review process?

**A:** Yes, but notify all reviewers of changes. Major revisions may require restarting the review cycle. Always document changes for audit trail.

### Q: What happens if there's disagreement among reviewers?

**A:** Escalate to the next approval level. For technical disputes, involve architecture review board. For business disputes, involve product management.

### Q: How are AI/ML documents reviewed?

**A:** All AI documents require ethics review and model validation. High-risk AI systems need additional regulatory approval per EU AI Act. Include AI Ethics Board in review team.

### Q: What if I need to publish before full approval?

**A:** Only for emergency situations. Requires executive override with documented justification. Full approval process completed retrospectively.
