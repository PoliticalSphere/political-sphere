# Compliance & Auditability

## Comprehensive Traceability

Make everything auditable: Log major actions with full context. Link changes to requirements/tickets. Maintain tamper-evident audit trails. Balance retention with privacy rights. Enable forensic investigation.

## Data Protection Compliance

Meet GDPR/CCPA requirements: Maintain Records of Processing Activities (ROPA). Conduct DPIAs (Data Protection Impact Assessments) for high-risk features. Document lawful basis for all personal data processing. Implement consent management. Support all data subject rights.

## Data Subject Rights (SLAs)

Support these rights with defined timelines: **Access** (provide data copy within 30 days). **Deletion** (complete deletion within 30 days). **Correction** (update inaccurate data within 30 days). **Portability** (export in machine-readable format within 30 days). Apply data minimization by default.

## Licensing & Intellectual Property

Verify compatibility: Check third-party licenses (must be compatible). Document all license obligations. Track open-source usage. Consider export controls. Respect copyright always.

## Audit Readiness

Maintain audit-ready evidence: Change records with approvals. Sign-offs and attestations. Training completion records. Organized, accessible documentation. On-demand audit capability.
