### Fixed

- DevContainer feature options: Removed unsupported `installYarnUsingApt` from Node feature and corrected `kubectl-helm-minikube` to use `kubectl` version key instead of `version`. Fixes Remote Containers feature parsing/build errors in the dev environment. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer tests: Updated `.devcontainer/test-devcontainer.sh` to `cd` into its own directory, ensuring relative paths resolve. Prevents spurious JSON syntax error when running the test from the repository root. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer hardening: Applied least-privilege defaults via `no-new-privileges`, dropped capabilities (`cap_drop: [ALL]`), and added `tmpfs` mounts for temp directories in compose. Test script now recognises compose-based settings. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer dependency install: Improved `.devcontainer/scripts/install-deps.sh` to skip `npm ci` when no lockfile is present and add a `--legacy-peer-deps` fallback to work around strict peer conflicts with npm v10+. Better logging when all attempts fail. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer npm defaults: Set npm config via containerEnv (legacy peer deps, disable audit/fund/progress, higher fetch retries/timeouts) to stabilise dependency installation during container creation. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer mounts: Removed `node_modules` and `.nx/cache` named volume mounts from `devcontainer.json` to avoid permission issues blocking npm install when running as the `node` user. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer postCreateCommand failure (exit 127): `wait-for-services.sh` now skips service checks if `docker` is not present and uses safe default expansion for `REDIS_PASSWORD` under `set -u`, preventing aborts and making the script idempotent. (2025-11-02)
- DevContainer UX: `docker-socket-perms.sh` skips unsafe changes when docker.sock GID is 0 and provides guidance; `status-check.sh` avoids pnpm workspace warnings and makes telemetry opt-in. (2025-11-02)
- Strict TypeScript compliance (exactOptionalPropertyTypes):
  - OTEL exporter URL now conditionally provided to avoid passing undefined
  - Playwright e2e config uses `shard: null` when not enabled
  - GitHub MCP server validates `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` format before use
  - AI Assistant rate limiter loop refactored to avoid undefined indexing
  - Controls runner avoids unreachable union branch property access
  - Context switch tracker omits optional `reason` when undefined (2025-11-02)
  - Removed explicit `any` types in GitHub MCP server; added safe narrowing for tool args and Octokit call params (2025-11-02)
  - Reduced ESLint warnings: tightened types in controls runner (`getByPath` uses unknown), removed unused imports in Git MCP placeholder, removed unused import in `scripts/find-leaky-types.ts`, removed `any` casts from telemetry error logging, and replaced explicit `any` in API stores with typed better-sqlite3 Statement generics (2025-11-02)
  - MCP servers lint cleanup: removed explicit `any` usage and added precise request param types; introduced safe error handling with `unknown` and message extraction; tightened Puppeteer `waitUntil` typing; added structural typing for `.connect(...)` to avoid `any` casts in Filesystem, Political Sphere, Puppeteer, and SQLite servers. Lint now passes with zero warnings. (2025-11-02)
  - DevContainer features: Replaced deprecated `ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/mkcert` with `ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/mkcert`; removed unsupported `runArgs` for Compose-based devcontainer (migrate constraints to docker-compose). JSON validation passes. (2025-11-02)

### Changed

- Renamed Playwright accessibility test config to `playwright-accessibility-config.ts` to satisfy ESLint filename regex (digits not allowed), removed duplicate legacy configs, and updated `test:a11y` script to reference the new file. This unblocks the a11y gate and keeps naming consistent with repository rules. (2025-11-02)

### Fixed

- **TypeScript Lint Errors**: Eliminated all 6 blocking TypeScript errors (inferrable type annotations, non-null assertions) in AI assistant and shared security modules. Reduced lint issues from 72 problems (6 errors, 66 warnings) to 65 warnings. Remaining warnings are explicit `any` types in data stores and MCP servers that don't block builds. (2025-11-02)

### Improved

- **README Documentation**: Comprehensive update documenting completed CI/CD infrastructure including security scanning (Gitleaks, Semgrep, CodeQL), supply-chain hardening (SBOM, SLSA provenance), observability verification, performance budgets with k6 gates, and governance controls system.
