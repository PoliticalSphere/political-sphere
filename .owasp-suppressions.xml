    This file contains suppression rules for false positives or accepted risks
    in dependency vulnerability scanning.
    
    Format: https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html
    
    Common suppression patterns:
    - False positives (CVE incorrectly matched to dependency)
    - Accepted risks (documented decision to accept vulnerability)
    - Dev dependencies (vulnerabilities in development-only packages)
    
    Each suppression MUST include:
    - notes: Why this is suppressed
    - until: Expiration date for review (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - filePath or gav: What dependency is suppressed
