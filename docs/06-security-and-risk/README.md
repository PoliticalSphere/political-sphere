## 🎯 Objectives

- Establish a robust security posture aligned with ISO 27001, GDPR, and ethical AI principles.
- Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks to protect users, data, and the platform.
- Ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and industry standards while maintaining zero-budget constraints.
- Foster a culture of security awareness and continuous improvement.

---

## 🧭 Security Principles

- **Zero Trust:** Assume breach; verify all access and actions.
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of controls across people, processes, and technology.
- **Privacy by Design:** Embed data protection and user rights into all systems.
- **Ethical AI:** AI systems must be transparent, accountable, and free from bias or manipulation.
- **Incident Readiness:** Prepare for, respond to, and learn from security incidents.
- **Compliance as Code:** Automate security checks and audits where possible.

## 📊 Risk Management Process

1. **Identify:** Regular threat modeling, dependency scans, and stakeholder input.
2. **Assess:** Evaluate likelihood and impact using the risk matrix.
3. **Mitigate:** Implement controls, transfer risk, or accept with monitoring.
4. **Monitor:** Continuous review and updates to the risk register.
5. **Report:** Quarterly reviews with the Security Council and stakeholders.

---

## 🧪 Security Testing and Validation

- **Automated Scans:** CI/CD includes SAST, DAST, dependency checks, and secret detection.
- **Penetration Testing:** Annual external assessments; internal red team exercises quarterly.
- **Compliance Audits:** Self-assessments against ISO 27001 and GDPR; external audits as needed.
- **AI Ethics Reviews:** Regular evaluations of AI systems for bias, transparency, and safety.
