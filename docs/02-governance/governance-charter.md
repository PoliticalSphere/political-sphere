# Governance Charter

## Purpose

This Governance Charter establishes the foundational principles, structures, and processes for governing Political Sphere. It ensures that all decisions — whether platform-level or in-game — are made transparently, accountably, and in alignment with the project's core values of fairness, safety, and ethical containment.

## Scope

This charter applies to:
- Platform operations and development decisions.
- Player safety and moderation policies.
- In-game governance and simulation rules.
- Changes to policies, features, or rules.
- Ethical and compliance considerations.

## Core Values

Political Sphere is governed by these non-negotiable values:

1. **Fairness:** Equal treatment for all players; no favoritism or pay-to-win.
2. **Transparency:** Decisions are documented, visible, and explainable.
3. **Accountability:** Actions are traceable; power is justified and auditable.
4. **Safety:** Zero tolerance for harm, harassment, or real-world mobilization.
5. **Ethics:** Simulation without real-world political persuasion or ideology.
6. **Procedural Integrity:** Rules follow process, not arbitrary decisions.
7. **Player Autonomy:** Strong in-game agency within ethical boundaries.

## Governance Layers

### 1. Platform Governance
- **Authority:** Real-world control over the platform, safety, and operations.
- **Holders:** Developers and administrators.
- **Responsibilities:** Ensure compliance, safety, and ethical operation.
- **Decision Process:** Structured proposals, ethical reviews, community input where appropriate.
- **Overrides:** Platform can intervene in-game only for safety, ethics, or legal reasons.

### 2. Player Governance
- **Authority:** In-game control over fictional parliamentary processes.
- **Holders:** Players in roles like Speaker, MPs, party leaders.
- **Responsibilities:** Govern the simulation world (debates, votes, rules).
- **Scope:** Purely fictional; cannot affect real-world rights or platform access.

## Decision-Making Framework

### Platform Decisions
- **Process:**
  1. Proposal (documented, ADR-style).
  2. Ethical & fairness impact assessment.
  3. Community consultation (if applicable).
  4. Approval by governance panel.
  5. Implementation with changelog.
  6. Public rationale publication.

- **Examples:** Feature changes, policy updates, moderation rules.

### In-Game Decisions
- **Process:** Handled via parliamentary procedures (motions, votes, committees).
- **Examples:** Rule changes, party formations, sanctions within the simulation.

## Moderation and Safety

### Principles
- Protect players above all else.
- No harassment, threats, hate, or personal abuse.
- No real-world political content or mobilization.
- Debate ideas, not identities.

### Process
- Reports triaged by humans (AI assists only).
- Investigations with full context.
- Proportionate responses (warnings → mutes → removal).
- Appeal rights always available.
- Transparency in reasons and logs (privacy-safe).

## Accountability Mechanisms

- **Audit Trails:** For all sensitive actions (bans, sanctions, rule changes).
- **Historical Records:** Immutable logs of world events and decisions.
- **Periodic Reviews:** Governance effectiveness assessed regularly.
- **Ethics Checklists:** Required for major changes.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Platform Responsibilities | In-Game Responsibilities |
|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Developers/Admins | Platform safety, feature dev, moderation oversight | None (unless playing) |
| Moderators | Enforce safety policies, handle reports | None |
| Players (General) | Report issues, provide feedback | Participate in simulation |
| Player Leaders (e.g., Speaker) | None | Enforce parliamentary rules |

## Change Management

- All changes to this charter require:
  - Documented rationale.
  - Ethical review.
  - Community notification.
  - 30-day review period.
  - Approval by majority governance panel.

## Compliance and Legal Alignment

- Adhere to relevant laws (GDPR, safety regulations).
- No data monetization.
- Ethical AI use only.
- Regular compliance audits.

## Success Metrics

- Fairness: <2% successful appeals.
- Trust: ≥85% player satisfaction with processes.
- Safety: Rapid response to incidents; minimal harassment.
- Stability: No unresolved governance controversies.

## Amendments

This charter can be amended via the change management process outlined above. All amendments are versioned and publicly logged.

## Ratification

This charter is effective immediately upon approval by the development team and serves as the foundation for all Political Sphere governance.
