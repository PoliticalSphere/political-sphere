## Owners & Contacts

- **SRE / On-call:** SRE Team — oncall@sre.political-sphere.example
- **Security owner:** security-team@political-sphere.example
- **Product / Release owner:** product-ops@political-sphere.example
- **Runbook location:** ./docs/09-observability-and-ops/operations.md

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs) & Acceptance Criteria

These acceptance criteria are required before production rollout. Concrete SLOs below must be added to the service SLA and validated by tests and observability dashboards.

- Availability (p99): 99.9% (target)
- Latency (p95): < 200ms for core API requests
- Error rate: < 1% (5xx responses) over rolling 5m window
- Data persistence: Backups verified with successful restore test at least weekly
- Recovery: RTO <= 4 hours, RPO <= 1 hour

Verification steps (smoke):

1. Run `scripts/ci/test-smoke.sh` against staging.
2. Verify CloudWatch/Prometheus dashboards for latency and error-rate baselines.
3. Run a backup-and-restore validation job and confirm data integrity.

## How to verify this checklist

1. Assign owners for SRE/Security/Product in the Owners section above.
2. Run automated verification: `npm run validate:env && npm run test:ci -- --smoke`.
3. Execute the backup-and-restore validation job: `scripts/backup/validate-restore.sh`.
4. Conduct a tabletop incident exercise with on-call and security for at least one high-severity scenario.
5. Add any last-minute deviations to the release ticket and obtain stakeholder sign-off.
