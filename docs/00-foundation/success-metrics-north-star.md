## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why focus on long-term outcomes rather than short-term engagement?

**A:** Political education requires time and sustained effort. Short-term metrics like daily active users don't capture whether we're actually helping citizens become more engaged in democracy. Our North Star ensures we're measuring real impact.

### Q: How do we balance quantitative metrics with qualitative insights?

**A:** We use quantitative metrics to track progress and qualitative research to understand why changes occur and how to improve. User interviews and focus groups provide context for the numbers.

### Q: What if external factors affect our metrics (elections, crises)?

**A:** We include external factor analysis in our quarterly reviews and adjust targets when major events significantly impact performance. We also track metrics during different political cycles to understand patterns.

### Q: How do we ensure metrics don't drive unethical behavior?

**A:** All KPIs must align with our core values and ethical principles. We include ethical compliance metrics and have oversight from our Ethics Committee on KPI design and targets.
