## Overview

Political Sphere does not currently have active partnerships or education strategies. This document outlines the potential framework for future collaborations and outreach, aligned with the mission of simulating politics as a system without real-world persuasion or activism.

## Core Principles

- **Mission Alignment:** Any partnerships must support the simulation of politics as a system, not activism or persuasion.
- **Ethical Boundaries:** No real-world political mobilization, ideology importation, or influence on beliefs.
- **Zero-Budget Mindset:** Focus on organic, community-driven outreach; avoid costly marketing or sponsorships.
- **Safety First:** Partnerships must not compromise player safety, fairness, or containment.

## Potential Collaborators

### Academic Institutions

- **Model Parliament Programs:** Universities with debate clubs or Model UN societies for educational tie-ins (fictional simulation only).
- **Political Science Departments:** Research collaborations on procedural fairness or governance simulations (data anonymized, no real-world application).

### Gaming Communities

- **Strategy Game Forums:** Outreach to Paradox Interactive or Civilization communities for cross-promotion (niche, ethical).
- **Indie Game Developers:** Shared events or showcases with similar ethical games (e.g., non-violent simulations).

### Educational Platforms

- **Online Learning Sites:** Partnerships for "civics education" modules using the simulation (fictional, neutral).
- **Debate Organizations:** Clubs focused on structured argumentation, not ideology.

### Community Groups

- **Strategy Gaming Meetups:** Local groups for beta testing and feedback.
- **Open-Source Communities:** Collaborations with free software advocates for transparency.

## Education Strategy

### Outreach Methods

- **Community Building:** Organic growth through forums, Discord, or Reddit (strategy/politics subs).
- **Content Creation:** Tutorials, lore, and procedural guides to educate players on parliamentary systems.
- **Events:** Virtual "parliamentary sessions" for new players to learn by participating.
- **Feedback Loops:** Surveys and playtesting to refine educational onboarding.

### Alignment with Mission

- Educate on procedural integrity, fairness, and strategic thinking.
- Avoid indoctrination or real-world political education.
- Focus on simulation mechanics and player agency.

## Prohibited Partnerships

- Real-world political organizations or parties.
- Advocacy groups or activist networks.
- Commercial entities seeking data or influence.
- Any partnership risking real-world persuasion.

## Future Activation

Partnerships will be considered only after core gameplay is stable and community trust is established. All proposals will be reviewed against ethical guidelines and mission principles.

## Summary

Partnerships and education will remain minimal initially, focusing on organic community growth and mission-aligned outreach to maintain safety and fairness.
