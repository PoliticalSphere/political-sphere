### Automated Quality Gates

The project enforces comprehensive quality standards through automated CI/CD pipelines:

#### **Governance Controls** (`.github/workflows/controls.yml`)

Machine-checkable rules defined in `docs/controls.yml`:

- ✅ PR mandatory headers validation
- ✅ ESLint zero-warning policy
- ✅ TypeScript strict typecheck
- ✅ Unit & integration tests
- ✅ Documentation linting
- ✅ Import boundary enforcement
- ✅ Accessibility validation
- ✅ Secret scanning

#### **Security Scanning** (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`)

Multi-layer security analysis:

- **Gitleaks**: Secret detection with redaction
- **Semgrep**: Custom SAST rules (console.log forbidden, ADR enforcement)
- **CodeQL**: Optional deep code analysis (main branch only)
- **SARIF Upload**: Security alerts integration

#### **Supply Chain Hardening** (`.github/workflows/supply-chain.yml`)

SLSA Level 2 provenance:

- **SBOM Generation**: CycloneDX bill of materials
- **Build Provenance**: Cryptographic attestation of build artifacts
- **Artifact Upload**: Versioned SBOM tracking

#### **Observability Verification** (`.github/workflows/observability-verify.yml`)

Runtime readiness checks:

- **OTEL Endpoint**: Validates observability configuration on main
- **Trace Instrumentation**: Ensures OpenTelemetry bootstrap present

#### **Performance Budgets** (`.github/workflows/performance.yml`)

k6 smoke tests with thresholds:

- **API**: p95 < 200ms, error rate < 1%
- **Frontend**: p95 < 500ms, cold start < 2s
- **Worker**: p95 < 100ms, error rate < 0.1%

### Required Secrets

Configure these in GitHub repository settings for full CI/CD functionality:

- `PERF_BASE_URL`: Performance testing endpoint (optional, skips if unset)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`: OpenTelemetry collector endpoint (required for observability verification on main)

## Testing

The project maintains comprehensive test coverage across multiple dimensions:

- **Unit Tests**: Jest with 80%+ coverage target for critical paths
- **Integration Tests**: API and service interactions with real dependencies
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user journeys with visual regression
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated WCAG 2.2 AA+ validation (zero serious+ violations policy)
- **Security Tests**: OWASP Top 10, secret detection, and dependency scanning
- **Performance Tests**: k6 smoke tests with p95 latency budgets

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test              # Unit tests with coverage
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests (Playwright)
npm run test:a11y         # Accessibility tests (axe-core)
npm run test:integration  # Integration test suite
```

### Test Configuration

- **Jest**: ESM-compatible with TypeScript transformation
- **Playwright**: Chromium engine for a11y tests (`playwright-accessibility-config.ts`)
- **Coverage**: NYC/Istanbul with branch and statement thresholds
- **Parallel Execution**: Nx affected tests with remote caching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**

- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
- Check Nx cache: `npx nx reset`

**Test Failures**

- Database issues: Ensure Docker services are running
- Coverage low: Focus on critical path tests first
- ESM issues: Check jest.config.cjs for module resolution

**AI Tooling Issues**

- Cache problems: Clear `ai-cache/` directory
- Performance slow: Enable FAST_AI mode with `FAST_AI=1`

**Pre-commit Hook Failures**

- Linting: Run `npm run lint` and fix issues
- Secrets: Remove any hardcoded credentials
- Boundaries: Check import paths follow Nx rules

**CI/CD Pipeline Failures**

- Controls failing: Review `docs/controls.yml` for specific requirements
- Security scan alerts: Check Gitleaks/Semgrep output, rotate exposed secrets immediately
- Build provenance: Ensure dist artifacts are generated before attestation
- Performance budget exceeded: Review k6 output and optimize hot paths

### AI Intelligence Features

The project includes advanced AI tooling for faster development:

- **Code Indexing**: Incremental semantic search with HNSW ANN (640-file corpus, 128-dim embeddings)
- **Context Preloading**: Pre-caches README, package.json, and common patterns
- **In-Memory Index Server**: Fast vector search at `/vector-search` endpoint
- **Novelty Guard**: Jaccard-based detection to prevent AI loops
- **Competence Monitoring**: Tracks AI suggestion quality and architectural decisions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measures cache hit rates, response times, and recall metrics

Enable fast mode with `FAST_AI=1` for reduced latency during development.
