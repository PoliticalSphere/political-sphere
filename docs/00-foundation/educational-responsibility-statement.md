# Educational Responsibility Statement

## Purpose
This document establishes Political Sphere's commitment to responsible educational use, ensuring that any incidental learning outcomes are validated, transparent, and aligned with democratic values.

## Educational Scope
Political Sphere is **not** a curriculum or educational platform. It is a multiplayer political simulation game designed for entertainment and strategic gameplay. Any educational benefits are incidental and not guaranteed.

## Validation Framework
We commit to:

### 1. Evidence-Based Claims
- All statements about educational value must be supported by independent research or user studies
- No unsubstantiated claims about "teaching democracy" or "civic education"
- Educational outcomes are measured, not assumed

### 2. Transparency in Intent
- Game mechanics prioritize fun and strategy over pedagogy
- Educational discussions are opt-in, not forced
- Players are informed that this is entertainment, not education

### 3. Independent Validation
- Educational claims require third-party validation (academic partners, user research)
- Regular audits of actual learning outcomes vs. stated goals
- Public disclosure of validation methodologies and results

### 4. Ethical Boundaries
- No manipulation of gameplay for educational purposes
- Respect for diverse political views and learning styles
- Accessibility ensures educational access is not a barrier

## Implementation Commitments

### User Communication
- Clear disclaimers in onboarding and tutorials
- Transparent documentation of any educational features
- User consent for participation in educational research

### Research Ethics
- IRB-approved methodologies for any educational studies
- Anonymized data collection with explicit consent
- Publication of findings regardless of outcomes

### Continuous Monitoring
- Regular review of educational claims against evidence
- Updates to this statement based on new research
- Stakeholder input from educators and researchers

## Validation Status
**Current Status**: No educational claims made. All features designed for gameplay first.

**Next Review**: Annual assessment of any emerging educational uses.
