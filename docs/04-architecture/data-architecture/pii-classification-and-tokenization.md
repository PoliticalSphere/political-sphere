## 🧰 Tokenization & Pseudonymisation

- **Email & Handle Hashing:** SHA-256 with per-tenant salt for analytics; reversible mapping stored in secure vault.
- **Session Identifiers:** UUIDv7 tokens stored in Redis; anonymised session IDs in analytics pipeline.
- **UGC Fingerprinting:** Perceptual hashes enable duplicate detection without exposing raw content.
- **Audit References:** Audit log stores pseudonymous actor IDs with lookup table accessible under break-glass.

## 🧾 Access Controls

- Role-based data access enforced via Prisma middleware (row-level security) and service-layer policies.
- Data exports require `privacy-manager` role and dual-approval workflow.
- PII queries logged and reviewed weekly; anomalies trigger security review.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

- Automated tests assert PII flags on schema fields; build fails if new columns added without classification.
- Privacy regression suite validates DSAR deletion paths, retention timers, and tokenization functions.
- Quarterly privacy drills simulate breach scenarios and validate incident response.
