## 🎯 Reliability Goals

- **Availability:** 99.9% MVP, target 99.95% with multi-AZ deployment.
- **Error Budgets:** Defined per SLO (API latency, realtime reliability, AI turnaround).
- **Recovery:** RTO ≤ 1 hr, RPO ≤ 5 min for core data stores.

---

## 🧱 Resilience Patterns

- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to cached results or human moderation when AI services degrade; read-only mode for parliamentary data if writes disabled.
- **Health Probes & Circuit Breakers:** Fastify health endpoints include DB/Redis checks; realtime gateway uses circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
- **Retry & Dead Letter:** Worker queues implement exponential backoff; dead-letter queues monitored for remediation; manual replay tools available.
- **Feature Flags:** LaunchDarkly (or OpenFeature) toggles allow progressive rollout and rapid disablement; flags audited.
- **Data Safeguards:** Soft deletes, versioned history tables, and audit log ensure recoverability and legal compliance.
- **Config Management:** GitOps or IaC-driven configuration with drift detection; secrets managed via Vault/KMS rotations.

## 🧪 Validation

| Exercise | Frequency | Owner | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| **Game Days** | Quarterly | Platform + Product | Simulate failure scenarios (DB outage, AI provider downtime, moderation surge) |
| **Chaos Experiments** | Monthly | SRE | Inject latency, kill pods, drop NATS cluster to validate resilience |
| **Failover Drills** | Semi-annual | Platform | Practice restoring from backups and switching to standby region |
| **Incident Reviews** | After incident | Cross-functional | Postmortems capture learnings, feed runbook updates |

## 🔔 Alerting & Escalation

- Severity matrix aligned with [Incident Response Plan](../INCIDENT-RESPONSE-PLAN.md).
- Pager rotation for Platform, AI Ops, Safety; on-call docs in [On-Call Handbook](../09-observability-and-ops/on-call-and-incident-handbook.md).
- Escalation path: On-call engineer → Incident commander → Platform lead/CTO.

## 📎 Supporting Artifacts

- [Production Readiness Checklist](../PRODUCTION-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md)
- [Disaster Recovery Runbook](../DISASTER-RECOVERY-RUNBOOK.md)
- [Incident Postmortem Template](../INCIDENT-POSTMORTEM.md)
- [Observability Architecture](./observability-architecture.md)

Reliability is a product feature—engineer for failure, rehearse recovery, and document everything.
