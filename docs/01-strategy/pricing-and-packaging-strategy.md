## Strategic Overview

Political Sphere’s pricing philosophy is built on one non-negotiable idea:

Every player gets full, equal access to the complete experience — no paywalls, no power boosts, no monetised influence.

There are no cosmetics, no ads, no loot boxes, and no premium gameplay advantages.
The game is financed solely through a single, modest monthly subscription.

This keeps incentives pure: development prioritises integrity and depth, not monetisation tricks.

## Core Pricing Model

| Aspect              | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model               | Subscription-only (B2C individual players)                                |
| Tiering             | One flat tier; all players receive identical features                     |
| Trial               | Optional short free trial (e.g. 7–14 days) with full access               |
| Price Philosophy    | "Modest, predictable, ethical" — affordable for students and young adults |
| Billing Frequency   | Monthly (annual optional later)                                           |
| Cancellation Policy | Cancel anytime, no penalty, access continues until end of period          |
| Refunds             | Simple, transparent, documented in fairness policy                        |
| Tax Handling        | Inclusive pricing; regional adjustments later if required                 |

**Example phrasing (for docs):** “One fair price for everyone. No tiers. No tricks. No power for sale.”

## Packaging Strategy

There are no content tiers or feature packages.
Every subscriber receives full access to:

- All core gameplay systems (debates, votes, parties, elections)
- Historical world archives
- Reputation and role progression
- Moderation and appeals tools (when in relevant roles)
- Party management and leadership systems
- Optional single-player sandbox (future)

**Why this matters:** The simulation relies on equality. Creating tiers breaks legitimacy.

## Fairness Principles Behind Pricing

- **Equality of Access:** Every player, regardless of means, experiences the full world.
- **No Financial Influence:** Money cannot buy credibility, power, or outcomes.
- **Predictability:** No hidden fees, upsells, or token systems.
- **Transparency:** Pricing visible and explained publicly.
- **Ethical Use of Funds:** Subscription revenue funds moderation, security, and development — not manipulation or advertising.

## Operational Considerations (Zero-Budget Stage)

### Before Launch

- No payment processor until open beta.
- Early closed tests: free, invite-only.

### After Launch

- Track only: active subscribers, churn rate, free-trial conversion, MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).
- Infrastructure: No premium server segregation. No additional fees for private worlds. If private hosting emerges, still within the single-tier subscription framework (player-to-player world hosting, not monetised).

## Accessibility & Inclusivity in Pricing

- Keep price low enough for students and early-career adults.
- Allow temporary grace periods for lapsed payments (7–14 days).
- Explore community-subsidised access later (not donations, but opt-in sharing schemes).
- Regional pricing parity possible in later phases if infrastructure supports it — but never cheaper = less content.

## Communication Strategy

Position the pricing as a trust pact with players:

“You pay a small subscription to keep the world fair, safe, and running — not to buy advantage.”

Language should highlight: fairness, simplicity, integrity, freedom from manipulation.

Avoid: marketing spin, fear-based messaging (“support us or we shut down”), elitism (“premium access”).

Tone: calm, principled, transparent.

## Prohibited Monetisation Models

These are explicitly off-limits and should appear in every governance doc:

- Ads
- Microtransactions
- Cosmetic DLC
- Institutional licences
- Data monetisation
- Political sponsorship
- Pay-to-skip or boost
- NFT / blockchain

## Long-Term Extensions

If revenue scales ethically, future optional add-ons (still flat-access) may include:

- “Family / Household Plan” (shared sub for multiple accounts)
- “Supporter Tier” (same content, optional higher payment for those who wish to fund development)
- “Lifetime Membership” (if recurring billing becomes complex)

But these must never affect gameplay, moderation influence, or political power.

## Governance of Pricing

Pricing changes must follow a transparent internal process, such as:

- Documented rationale in governance register
- 30-day public notice before change
- No retroactive effect
- Maintained affordability principle
- Recorded as an ADR (Architectural Decision Record)

This keeps financial decisions ethically auditable — same as code and rules.
